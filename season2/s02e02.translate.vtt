1
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.640
-Oh!
- Don't sleep, then!

2
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.320
Ouch!

3
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.680
Thank you Orm for the round you are getting now.

4
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.160
Ouch!

5
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.280
Ouch!

6
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.800
Ouch!

7
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.040
Ouch!

8
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.640
Yes, yes. We are never stronger
than the weakest link.

9
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.280
Hey you ...

10
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.760
-Aren't you linked?
-I volunteer.

11
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.360
Depends on the pain wheel.
Getting grumpy without a good session per day.

12
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.760
What kind of torture is this?
Walking around and around?

13
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.560
We are privileged to work outside
in Odin's free nature. Good workout.

14
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.680
Orm begins
to gain some muscle already.

15
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.680
Your body responds
extremely good at exercise. Impressive.

16
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.520
-Thanks. Thanks.
-Yes. We're driving.

17
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.600
Then we drive on.

18
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.880
I just have to say that I have a very,
very good feeling on this.

19
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.800
Jarl Varg is not always
just as easy to read.

20
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.040
But then he acted in a way
positive to get some air out.

21
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.600
Well ... There was something wrong
feedback and values ​​and such.

22
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.720
Anyone want to start?

23
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.200
I might as well start.

24
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.600
It's a good part
here left with a little ...

25
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.240
... ugly feeling
    after what happened in Norheim.

26
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.920
You go somewhere to get a map,
and then you end up killing.

27
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.480
And it was sodomy and attempted rape.

28
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.360
You become a little uncertain about you
is on the good team anymore.

29
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.040
Any other thoughts around it?

30
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.080
Magnus der.

31
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.320
I think what Håkon thinks is that we
must set some defined values.

32
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.520
And agree
an emotionally rooted goal -

33
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.360
- for our entire business here.

34
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.680
Other input?
Mariana?

35
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.600
I speak for the younger soldiers.
We need a clear "why".

36
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.640
Why should we join
on this journey?

37
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:34.320
Then it might be okay to drive
a process and find our values?

38
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.880
So ...
That's how I feel, then.

39
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.440
I mean sexuality
cannot be put in booths.

40
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.280
A digression. But I will be
aware that even though I'm a big guy,

41
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.440
- then you have to look at me
  like one of the guys on the floor.

42
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.760
I'm ready to pull my weight.
This is fun.

43
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.120
Look - I'm an ax man!

44
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.800
Relax a bit, then, Bendel ...

45
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.160
Think body work is so much fun.

46
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.840
After all, it's incredibly nice. And I
practicing on me a sexual physique.

47
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.440
Because I am so easy going. So I train
enough on me an attractive physics fast.

48
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.560
-I pretty much doubt that.
- But just wait and see. Wait and see.

49
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.360
Get the pins.
Good. And then it.

50
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.040
You guys, I really liked
the energy we got in the room here now.

51
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.840
It was
really good suggestions we got.

52
00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.240
But we still landed
that our new values ​​are:

53
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.280
Curious.

54
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.480
Raus.

55
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.240
-And playful.
-Isn't it pretty nice values?

56
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.880
The challenge just becomes
to implement them.

57
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.640
-But it must not be too complicated.
- Is that the way management is behind?

58
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.720
-Yes.
-It's not too radical?

59
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.120
No.

60
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.120
I feel ten pounds lighter.
I have to admit that I've been dreading.

61
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.880
Such processes can be painful
both for employees and for management.

62
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.040
I'll take off your hat for you, Jarl
Varg, to be so willing to change.

63
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.000
Fascinating.

64
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.560
Others who have input
on leadership style and values?

65
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.560
You young?
Need a clearer "why"?

66
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.240
I was to blame
each one of you,

67
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:29.040
- ripped off your testicles
  in a violent maneuver.

68
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.280
I didn't get all the names with me.

69
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.640
Let's take a little round
what we are called, what hobbies we have?

70
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.280
-Wouldn't it have been nice, then?
-No, actually.

71
00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.160
-Don't be so nuts then. Sit down.
-When the Vikings see it, we'll be whipped.

72
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:06.400
Nine out of ten concerns are unfounded.
Turn it off a bit.

73
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.200
We can ...

74
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.840
You are actually the first one
I've brought down here.

75
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.280
It's incredibly nice here, then.

76
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.840
Yes, it is
a very calm here.

77
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.600
It's here I come
to think the big thoughts.

78
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:05.040
Which:
What is beyond the stars?

79
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.520
No.
More like mountains.

80
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.480
Big stones.
Whales I can think of occasionally.

81
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.160
Moose. Logs.

82
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:26.200
That's not exactly what it is,
only there are great things.

83
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.840
Maybe you want to start, Rufus?
You have an exciting story, after all.

84
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.360
I really don't care.

85
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.160
I do not share from mine
amazing life with sub human beings.

86
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.200
Here we are all sub-humans, Rufus.

87
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:50.280
-I really don't care.
- But then I start.

88
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.360
My name is Orm.
Rightful heir to the throne.

89
00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:02.560
Love art and culture.
But most of all I love people.

90
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.840
Been a lot alone.
Don't like it.

91
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.440
Very best I have it
in a tightly welded bunch -

92
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.800
- doing things together all the time
  day in and day out -

93
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.920
- until the gang merges
  to one organism -

94
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:27.200
- with lots of intern jargon and jokes
  and things people outside do not understand.

95
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.520
That's my dream.

96
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.680
Here it was nice!

97
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.160
-Are you sitting?
-No, it was ...

98
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.960
Orm insisted that we
should organize such a ...

99
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.080
-Get known ...
-Be-known round.

100
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.080
He's new and didn't know any better.
I'll take one for the team.

101
00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.600
There will be no "take one for the team".
It gets whipped on all men.

102
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.120
Without you, Orm.
You didn't sit.

103
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.200
-Shall we take it right away?
-Yes.

104
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.280
-Oh!
-Au!

105
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.000
You? I am very happy
that you would come down here.

106
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.440
Because that's something I've been thinking
to ask you.

107
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.320
Oh well?

108
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.840
What?

109
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.880
-Shall we tie the knot?
- Knot the knot?

110
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.880
-Engage us?
-Is it a ring?

111
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:05.400
Had to make one of the foreskin.
I hope it's okay.

112
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:14.680
-Don't you? I understand well ...
- Yes, yes. I want that.

113
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.960
-So then we are engaged then, right?
-Yes.

114
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.600
To ...

115
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:28.920
-Hey dear. Had a nice day?
-Liv. You came back.

116
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.320
What is the legislature doing here?
Hey, by the way.

117
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.360
We screwed up
in my rights.

118
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.800
It was a lot that was new to me.

119
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.400
You've thrown out your wife
for no valid reason.

120
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:51.120
After all, she egged Jarl Varg on
to fertilize her! Valid reason!

121
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:56.720
Egg up? It was an abuse. You
did not lift a finger to help.

122
00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:02.840
You're very weak here, Arvid.
Let us review all the facts.

123
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.160
I feel I have mine in the dry.

124
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:15.800
Liv, you say you lived a happy life
with Olvar, the richest farmer here?

125
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:21.680
We had a relationship based on that
mutual respect and understanding.

126
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.960
We cultivated each other
and the good conversation.

127
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.720
Especially.

128
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:33.520
Arvid, you split Liv's man in two
to take over her and the farm.

129
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.040
Is that right.
It was just after the book.

130
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:44.280
And you boxed Liv's best friend
in the face so the nose became disfigured?

131
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.840
Yes, but she deserved it.

132
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.240
And while your best friend
lay to death -

133
00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:57.560
- you sprayed penile milk
  into his wife,

134
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.440
- so Hildur
  now pregnant with your baby?

135
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:11.120
And you deceived Liv with Frøya, et
conditions based on animal attraction?

136
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.240
There are feelings there too.

137
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:21.920
You know what? Everything points to
that you have gone far beyond the line.

138
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:28.600
I am very, very disappointed.
It is so incredibly honored.

139
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:33.600
You owe Liv
a huge excuse.

140
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.000
Loke, ass.

141
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.040
I'm sorry
that I got you all whipped.

142
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:08.360
It's really a little cool stuff
we can all look back on and laugh at.

143
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.400
-Which ties us stronger together.
-Sure, Orm.

144
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.600
Anyway - now my throat is screaming
after a lukewarm mead or two.

145
00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.040
What do you guys say?
And the girl?

146
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.040
I guess I just have to
to get me home.

147
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.600
It won't be Friday night for me.

148
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:35.600
I am weak at cultivating the camaraderie at the end of the work week.

149
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:41.240
We work every day of the year, we,
so for us the week is never over.

150
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.720
-It just keeps going.
-Another day.

151
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.560
-Tomorrow?
- Or maybe a little later.

152
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.480
-We just see it.
- I don't want to lock me.

153
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.360
But we are doing this ...
Or next week, then?

154
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.320
-Yes, what is it?
-Liv?

155
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.640
Yes.

156
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.560
-So you're back, right?
-Is that right.

157
00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.280
-Is Arvid there?
- The chief will not be disturbed.

158
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.240
So just keep watch,
or what you do.

159
00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.520
You should lie so insanely low.
Pair up like that in the system.

160
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:08.040
And that style.
Maybe not quite 791, right?

161
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.720
-What do you mean?
-It's better to say.

162
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.600
Not to be cocky,
but you look like a simple path whore.

163
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.920
Come on. Kill your life
the chieftain and become riveting.

164
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.800
I'm going to sit in Valhall and enjoy myself
over being chased like a beehive.

165
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.680
-Who was it?
- A whore that had gone wrong.

166
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.880
Wrong?
There are five houses throughout Norheim.

167
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.960
I just know it was an extreme
horny lady who had gone wrong.

168
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.320
-Where is he?
- He should be here now.

169
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:25.520
He tends to be precise.
At least he comes highly recommended.

170
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.880
If anyone can
steal the map, then he is.

171
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.800
Even if you have a title as a master thief,
then you should be punctual.

172
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.320
I look at my wrist
when I'm waiting for someone.

173
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.760
What's that?

174
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.920
It's a coffin
which was delivered earlier today.

175
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.320
But I know then Loke
what's up there.

176
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.360
A great trick!

177
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.160
Troll in box.
Soon the map to the West -

178
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.120
- my!

179
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.440
Okay, guys.
Big day.

180
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.960
We will do something like no chieftain
in Norheim has done for generations.

181
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.320
We are going to collect taxes.
Or protection money.

182
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.720
-Isn't that Jarl Varg's thing?
-Yes.

183
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.040
But that is the privilege
to the most powerful chief.

184
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.480
As of now it is actually me.

185
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.320
Yes, I'm back. You haven't
told people that your wife is back?

186
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.280
No. I think maybe
I told someone ...

187
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.760
No.

188
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.720
You should keep the hungry
your fingers off the dish.

189
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:17.760
By chick hungry, I mean you don't
should touch on Arvid down there. On the cock.

190
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.520
-I realized what you mean, Liv.
-Good.

191
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.680
As a first lady, I command you
to keep an eye on those fingers.

192
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.880
It's Loki's fingers.
Insidious and infamous -

193
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.440
- constantly looking for mushrooms -
  bodies, body openings and cavities.

194
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.920
-Good luck then, dear.
-Thanks.

195
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.800
Sorry, ass.
She just came back suddenly.

196
00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:57.040
And so says the legislature
that she somehow has the law on her side.

197
00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.080
I do not quite know
what to do with it.

198
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:06.720
-You know you have an extra responsibility?
-Yes. Or what do you mean?

199
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.880
You just know too well
how insanely good you look, -

200
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
- and then you count
  that everything will be fine.

201
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.000
I do not know.

202
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:23.160
It comes with a responsibility
to have the look you have -

203
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.680
- and the perfect body.

204
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:31.680
Yes, I'm a reasonable face pen,
but I struggle a little with my back.

205
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:37.760
It makes me look a little full,
so perfectly I probably am not.

206
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.880
Anyway, it was nice to be
Engage with you. Great.

207
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.600
It was ten nice hours, that.

208
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:56.360
I think we should take a break, me.
I need to think a little.

209
00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.640
Is not pause
the same as looking up?

210
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:06.600
-How is it related?
-I do not know. You're married, after all.

211
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:13.200
Maybe you should think a little, you too.
On how to deal with it.

212
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.840
Put it there.
Everything is going out.

213
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.120
Uh ... Throw it there.

214
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:42.240
-Hi, Hildur.
- Liv, so incredibly nice.

215
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.320
I've been so worried about you.

216
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.760
-Isn't that my cape and my coat?
-Yes. After all, you should move out.

217
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.360
No, the heiress and I
must live in the longhouse.

218
00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:02.240
-The plans have been changed.
-We'll wait until Arvid comes home.

219
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:08.120
I am the chieftain. I command you
forget this warm, lovely house -

220
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.520
- and move into a tent
  or a gaping hook or something.

221
00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:19.160
Couldn't you just been eaten off
a gray leg? Everything was better without you.

222
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.760
Unlike you,
who has clung to influence, -

223
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.280
- then I worked for it.
  And now I'm back.

224
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.320
This time
I will not go out.

225
00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.840
Then that horn
you can hatch far from here.

226
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:44.440
You can cast your horned egg
far from here. With all due respect.

227
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.040
-Greetings, Eigil.
- Chief Arvid. Welcome.

228
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:16.440
-What is the reason for this visit, then?
-I heard a lot about your farm.

229
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.680
I wanted to see it with my own eyes.
An incredibly nice place.

230
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.680
Yes, no, life plays here.

231
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:35.520
I have to admit that I have
had a horn in your side -

232
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.600
- since the episode
  with my twin brother.

233
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.560
Yes, that is regrettable, that.
But that's the rules now.

234
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.840
Because you shouldn't
challenge me to holmgang?

235
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:54.800
-No not at all.
-It was good.

236
00:25:54.920 --> 00:26:01.400
It was quite traumatic
experience to bury Olvar.

237
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.480
It was in a sense two corpses.
After all, he was split completely into two.

238
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:12.800
-That kind of tracks, that is.
-I see it, Eigil.

239
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:19.600
Either way, we're here to introduce something
called protection money.

240
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:25.160
Which is about people
with power, like us, -

241
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:32.160
- offers us to protect people who
  are completely powerless, like you.

242
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.520
What a fantastic concept.

243
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:45.160
I didn't expect that
to hear from you, -

244
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:50.480
- not after you split your brother
  mine in two just to get you mice.

245
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.960
No, it was because of the farm.

246
00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.880
But this is about you having to pay
us so we don't attack you.

247
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.680
-Why should you attack us?
-If you don't pay, then.

248
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.720
I do not understand ...

249
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:21.720
-Yes, that's the concept.
-Yes ...

250
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.960
Let's take a look
and see what we find, we.

251
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.280
Suppose you just throw out Hildur.

252
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:16.200
Should our relationship be in the right place,
we can't have her living here.

253
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:22.280
She is vulnerable when pregnant.
She can stay here until the baby arrives.

254
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.800
No.
It's the recipe for cohabitation.

255
00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.800
Having a horny free whore in the house.

256
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.320
I'm not that good.
