1
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.720
Lots of wasps?

2
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.920
Did not know the legislature
was so fond of honey.

3
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.680
Arvid! Arvid!
Don't go in there!

4
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.480
It may be best that I sacrifice myself.
The sight can traumatize you for life!

5
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.640
Or it's not something traumatic.
I've never been there before.

6
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.560
What the hell
is that what happened here?

7
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.280
The legislator?
Legislators!

8
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.240
Legislators!

9
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.440
Don't know his name. Called him
only the legislature. Why are you here?

10
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.000
He was like a guy who was a lot in
the village where I grew up, for me.

11
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.880
It's important to be here now.

12
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.280
-Lovgiver?
-Niding ...

13
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.880
-Nid ...
-Viking, yes. We know what we are.

14
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.360
-Niii ...
-Viiiking, yes.

15
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.120
- Something has hung up here.
-He says nid.

16
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.520
-No.
- It was Orm ...

17
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.480
Yes. I just did it, me.

18
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.760
So you let go of the burden with one
mercy killing. Took one for the team.

19
00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.120
It's going to haunt me,
but I have relieved him of the pain.

20
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.920
The sky has been given a new star.

21
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.160
Wait, wait, wait, it looks like
he clenched something in his hands.

22
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.760
- Wondering what was so important ...
- I'll take them.

23
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.160
Has he written anything? Any last words?
The legislator's words were law after all.

24
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.920
"Today will be an exciting day."

25
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.920
"I need to release a wasp swarm" -

26
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.560
- "to test if I
   is still allergic. "

27
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.040
Jeez, a weird choice
one that was so allergic.

28
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.960
People are different.
Some people like to challenge themselves.

29
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.640
"If anything happens to me, I command
 that the new legislature in Norheim "-

30
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.840
- "should be a man of
   superior intellectual capacity. "

31
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.160
- "Rufus of Rome."
-What?

32
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.840
Jeez ...

33
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.400
"I realize I've committed
 great injustice to Orm. "

34
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.240
Right?

35
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.040
"My last command is that Orm
 will no longer be slavery. "

36
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.160
- Lord Tor, it's all up.
-No mockery of his.

37
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.200
Those are his last words.
His words are law.

38
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.720
-Yes, unfortunately.
-Is there something more there too?

39
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.240
"Orm must be actively included
 in all social contexts. "

40
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.360
Yes, Arvid, Frøya, Ragnar. Then it looks
as if the tables have turned again.

41
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.360
- The tables have turned?
-Yes. Or not quite.

42
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.000
That the tables are a little twisted.
Either way, I'm a free man.

43
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.480
And that means, well, Frøya,
that we are married again.

44
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.320
-Forget it.
-Rufus, you're the new legislator.

45
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.480
-Your word is now allowed.
-Thanks.

46
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.920
I'm going to read up so I can give
a decision based on legal sources.

47
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.200
- Now you arrived in time for dinner.
-We'll just get our stuff.

48
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.200
And to say that we are superhuman,
and you are still sub-humans.

49
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.800
I have become a free man,
and Rufu's new legislature.

50
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.080
- It was violent then. Congratulations.
Fold your hand! Your nasty hand.

51
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.880
- Is it called "fold your hand"?
-Yes. And camaraderie is out of date.

52
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.720
I am as of today
the most powerful man in the village.

53
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.800
I will soon become chief, and then
Rufus sails our ship to Rome ...

54
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.200
You do not tell Odin and every man
about secret plans.

55
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.440
I was just a little torn up.

56
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.760
Orm will not be the chief.
We have an excellent chief in Arvid.

57
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.760
We have no plans to overthrow him.

58
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.640
And we express with this
full confidence in Arvid.

59
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.400
-That's okay.
-Yes. Okay.

60
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.240
But don't think I forgot
how you froze me out.

61
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.880
Winter is coming for you three.

62
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.760
Or "winter is coming" ...?
No, winter is coming.

63
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.600
Winter is coming.

64
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:08.360
Then the time has come to formally
introduce our new legislature.

65
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.600
-Yes, questions?
-Is it just me who thinks it's weird?

66
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.760
That the legislature writes down its
latest wishes and dies right afterwards?

67
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.000
It's like taken right out
of a crime pin.

68
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.000
It had become a commonplace
and a dull crime pin.

69
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.880
It is quite common. Ordinary.

70
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.760
That's not it, Orm.
I think it's very suspicious.

71
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.560
That was Odin's plan.

72
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.840
And my girl, it would have been better
style of you to enjoy this, -

73
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.640
- instead of being suspended
  in the past. It doesn't suit you.

74
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:02.960
Little friend, you could be attractive
without that suspension in the near past.

75
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.880
And in spinning things up,
put question rounds.

76
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.160
Now you just throw it away.
It's sad. Sad to see.

77
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.680
-Oh well.
- No wonder you're single.

78
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.680
Nobody has the strength to be
along with a sniff cock.

79
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.880
My dear ...

80
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.560
Yes.
Some would have to say that.

81
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.160
Legislators Hatten
is a big hat to fill, -

82
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.960
- so I hope you
  will carry it with dignity.

83
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:59.200
Hereby I declare Rufus
as Norheim's new legislator.

84
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.360
Thanks. The first
I do as a legislator -

85
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.080
- is to make it optional for
  the legislature to wear the hat.

86
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.600
Especially a hat that is so
full of lice and lizards like it.

87
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.000
The old legislature must get
a funeral worthy of its rank.

88
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:29.280
It is important that everyone sends the most
precious they have, with him to Valhall.

89
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.480
Here we have to give so it stings.

90
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.200
In Vestfold they have begun
to bury big men in ships.

91
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.680
They are digging down the entire ship
with lots of nice stuff up there.

92
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.200
The ship is
the most valuable we have.

93
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.520
But you also become very
the wing clip as a Viking without a ship.

94
00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:03.200
Yes, it will be fucking fun for everyone,
but we should give it so it stays.

95
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.760
- Maybe we should do it?
- The ship is not to be buried.

96
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.800
It is reserved for elite burials.
Chieftains and artists.

97
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.520
Rufus.
Good decision with that ship.

98
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.480
It was stressful to build a new one.

99
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.880
Yes, it was a right one
and wise decision.

100
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.040
Now I hope the legislature
was right about you.

101
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:06.760
We've had our disagreements,
but we get the best out of it.

102
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.280
Clearly. We have to
just make the best of it.

103
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:19.160
Good. I have a good feeling about you.
You and I can become a good team.

104
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:44.560
The thing with me ... The body is mine
rune stick, the tattoos are my story.

105
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.440
Cool.

106
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.200
As I said: A man with a tattoo
has an interesting history.

107
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:58.520
Everyone has some kind of tattoo now.
Does everyone have an interesting story then?

108
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:04.400
Yes, the thing with me is that I am
a canvas of my experiences, -

109
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:10.000
- My story is etched
  with lines, shadows -

110
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.480
- you can see them on your arms, shoulders,
  your back, stomach, legs ...

111
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.320
What exactly is the story
behind the lines there?

112
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.640
They remember the women people I've had.

113
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.200
But many people are sick.
- Begins to be a part.

114
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:34.120
But that must be just about everyone
the ladies who are within ten miles of circumference.

115
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:40.080
-You've been up for it.
-It's not just physical penetration.

116
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:46.840
Two of them are physical, the rest are
fantasy penetrations. Held on self.

117
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.680
One line for each time
you have pulled yourself into a hand trolley?

118
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.320
No, just the runes I want to remember.
Then I can mimic and such.

119
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.040
Small pages in the Ragnar saga.

120
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.080
-Okay. Cool.
- I know.

121
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:18.920
Really good. Tattoos show
that you are an interesting person.

122
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.560
Yes, the other guys seemed
I had to have some more ink.

123
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.360
Me and Frøya on the battlefield.

124
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.480
Do you have a picture of Frøya on your back
when you are still married to Liv?

125
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.720
Yes. It's Frøya and me
forever anyway.

126
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.320
- You think so?
-Yes. Some things you just know.

127
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:46.120
- Was it something special?
-Yes, Rufus and Orm came by.

128
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:54.760
- And they were so very excited.
- Yes, Rufus has become a legislator.

129
00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:01.000
But Orm talked about
that he should become chief and stuff.

130
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.240
I think they want something. Not before
to stress you out, but I'm worried.

131
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.200
But nine out of ten concerns
is unfounded.

132
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.880
Do not dig in
concerns. There's something to it.

133
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.160
But thank you for telling me.
All I have to say is:

134
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.560
You are the best
the subhuman I have owned.

135
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.320
- I mean, ass.
- It was violent then. Thank you.

136
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.480
-We'll see you at the funeral, then.
-Talk.

137
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.320
Oh, go to Loke ...

138
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.400
-Dog? What are you doing here?
- I come to pay my respects.

139
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.880
-Pay my respect? Do you say that?
-I think so.

140
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.560
Jarl Varg sends his condolences ...
Kondolasjoner?

141
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.880
-Kondolanser.
- Sorry it got a little stiff.

142
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Funerals are so difficult.
What is right to say?

143
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.760
Can you smile when you meet
old famous and like that?

144
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.880
There is no facet to that. The
the most important thing is that you ask. So thank you.

145
00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:05.440
It is mostly coins, but some pebbles
at the bottom, so it feels heavy.

146
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.800
It looks like the first one
the domino has fallen.

147
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.920
Domino chip?

148
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.800
Don't overlook
that the Arvid chip is the next one.

149
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.240
Arvid chip?
What is domino for something?

150
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.960
Domino is a game like Varg
brought from a merchant -

151
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.720
- from somewhere down the road.

152
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:43.400
Putting the pieces in succession,
you can trigger a chain reaction.

153
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.880
Then the pieces fall one by one.
Would say so.

154
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.080
Something I should know
what a chain reaction is?

155
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.360
I know what I am
have been told to say.

156
00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.360
Now it's up to you
to interpret it as you please.

157
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.560
I just don't know what to interpret.

158
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:11.520
I'm just passing on a message.
Varg said I should say.

159
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.720
But do you understand the essence?
Is it a threat, or what is it?

160
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:22.240
Yes, that's probably a threat.
I'm pretty sure.

161
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.720
The ridge is,
is there any collection afterwards?

162
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.680
Any food or snacks?

163
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:49.520
It will be a memory afterwards.
For close relatives and friends.

164
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.520
I was going to go anyway.

165
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.760
It paints and smirks.
Yes, talk.

166
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:30.960
Oh, great Odin,
welcome the legislature in Valhall.

167
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.400
Grave.

168
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.640
Just a quick input?

169
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.120
We should send
anyone on the trip too?

170
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:52.000
-What do you mean?
- He must have slaves on the journey.

171
00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.640
A very good suggestion.

172
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.080
I think all three, me.

173
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.600
Then there is no one left to dig
heap. Kark almost has to dig.

174
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.160
You two, then.
No buzz!

175
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.800
It is an honor
to be buried with superhuman beings.

176
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.840
Yes, yes ...

177
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.400
-Is it possible to eat some of the fruit?
- Of course not.

178
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:36.480
It is human food as the legislature
should bring with them to Valhall.

179
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.360
Kark! Grave.

180
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:52.760
Good luck in Helheim. Doubt that
Valhall has a place for freezers.

181
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:58.120
Now we believe in neither Valhall nor
Helheim, so this is going to be a bomb trip.

182
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.200
I am Christian.

183
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.200
I believe in Jesus of Nazareth.
This does not make sense.

184
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.160
You just have to bite it in you.
Lie! Deck!

185
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:16.400
It is a little contrary to the self-preservation drive to be buried.

186
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:22.160
That's how it is.
Enough about that matter.

187
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.040
But hell, then.
Kark - your hand.

188
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.120
Your hand!

189
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.880
Allow me.

190
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.200
Yes.

191
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.520
Well, well, well.
Kark.

192
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.040
The tree of exclusion
bears bitter fruits.

193
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.160
What?

194
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.480
I'm not a man
one is excluded from the company.

195
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:04.600
You missed one Friday meeting.
And then you do it here.

196
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:10.360
- It's my friends who are there.
-You'd rather drink with them.

197
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.600
I'm sorry about that.

198
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:19.560
However, there will be new times here,
and then it won't be easy to be Kark.

199
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:25.000
Being a Kark is not very easy
now either. After all, I am totally out of poverty.

200
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.520
I am 18 years old and I am
Looks like I'm well over 40.

201
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:35.480
Anyway, now it's going to be grave beer,
and you are not invited.

202
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:42.040
Or, we might
need you to serve, so then ...

203
00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.200
Then we will see there.

204
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.840
There is so much excitement in the body.
A lot.

205
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:04.920
My latest discovery is one
walnut-sized gland at the end there -

206
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:10.840
- an extremely erogenous zone
  which gives pleasure de luxe ...

207
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:19.280
Rufus. We talked about ...
Have you read the rules about ...

208
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.080
-Rettskildene.
- About marriage?

209
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:28.920
If one spouse is nurturing,
whether it still applies?

210
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.000
The stuff there, yes.

211
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:40.440
It feels like when the bitch
is released, so is the marriage.

212
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.320
So good, Frøya. Then I crawl
into your armpit tonight.

213
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:51.880
-No, you shouldn't.
-But then you have to cut yourself very short!

214
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.120
Preferably spigot!

215
00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.120
Frøya ...

216
00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.440
Frøya, that solves.
There must be a solution.

217
00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.960
-I can't be married to Orm!
-I understand that.

218
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.800
-But that's how the rules are.
- We have to be able to do something.

219
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:20.680
I have faith that it will work out when
we get on the thing. It will be alright.

220
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:26.040
-Why do you think that?
-To good things happen to good people.

221
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.480
And we're good, then.
U.S. two.

222
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.480
- Who are we?
- We are.

223
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.000
Hey Hey.
Here it was crowded.

224
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:20.000
It stops here, Arvid.
You heard what I said. It stops here.

225
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.480
No more "protection money".

226
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.040
Yes, we must.
Otherwise, you are no longer protected.

227
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.600
What you see here, Arvid,
is a peasant army.

228
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.960
You are witnessing a grassroots riot.

229
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.920
The rebellion here is going to spread.

230
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:46.080
And when we are done, it will come
to be a new social structure.

231
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:53.560
The people must decide, not
a power elite that exploits the weak.

232
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.360
Time is ripe
for a new governance set.

233
00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.760
We demand majority decisions
in elected bodies.

234
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.040
Yes, that sounds solid.
What do you say?

235
00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.440
Fantastic.
I have been looking forward to this.

236
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:19.480
I think we should give Eigil that thing.
I think he deserves it now.

237
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:25.400
But where did I make it, then?
Just think a little ...

238
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:31.080
- You didn't pack it on the horse, did you?
-Yes, it's possible.

239
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.440
Here it is, you know.

240
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.160
Here it is.

241
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.840
Is it a fist?

242
00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.200
Or ...

243
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:06.200
Is it a symbol of the power of the people?

244
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.040
Right in the solar plexus.
I can not breathe!

245
00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.440
-Oh, au!
-Yes, yeah, yeah.

246
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.000
Do we agree
that the peasant revolt is over?

247
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.160
-Absolutely.
- They underestimate the war profession -

248
00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:44.760
- if you only believe
  decides to become a warrior.

249
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.520
Yes ...

250
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:52.880
Sorry we took a little,
but we need a little extra on things.

251
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.080
-Great. We talk.
-Yes, we're talking.

252
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.560
We talk, we, Arvid.

253
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.160
We talk before you know it.
