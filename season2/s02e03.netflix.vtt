WEBVTT

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.840
As I'm sure you know,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.760
Arvid and his gang

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.040
of vermin and pests from Norheim

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.400
have stripped me of my hands.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.400
But that is something

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.080
Jarl Varg considers a challenge.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.000
Not a problem!

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.600
Or... two challenges,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.080
and not two problems.
I guess.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.000
And this blacksmith

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.040
has made new prostheses for me.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.640
These.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.880
Miserable craftsmanship.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.000
Nowhere near up to standard.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.200
I want prostheses
that are better than hands.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.400
Prostheses that will give me an advantage.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.240
Both in daily life

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.640
and battle.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.200
Jarl, I tried my best, I really did.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.120
But this is the year 791.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.000
And that is how far we have come

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.880
in our metalworking.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.960
Right?

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.480
Yes.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.520
You are Norway's best blacksmiths.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.520
He who gives me the best prostheses

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.520
will become a rich man.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.200
Rich beyond belief.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.880
The rest

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.600
shall follow this fate...

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.760
What?
No!

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.400
No, I beg you.
No.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.400
Please, I beg you. Have mercy!
Please, Jarl! No!

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.040
I have a family, Jarl.
Please.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.320
Jarl, have mercy.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.360
No!

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.760
All right!

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.840
It happened. It should not have happened,
but it happened.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.680
And so I will learn from this.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.120
And I will go over my routines
and I will fix this.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.480
Jarl, please, I beg you!

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.600
I should have had
some birch bark or...

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.720
Maybe some dry grass. I wonder if
these branches have gotten a little wet.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.480
It worked when I tried it
earlier today.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.080
Nope.
Nothing.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.880
No.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.600
It's not working.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.880
That was very unfortunate.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.640
My bad.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.240
Now,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.240
join me on a small journey.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.920
Close your eyes,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.360
and imagine that
the fire is burning like crazy.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.480
The flames crackle pleasantly

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.760
and start licking the body
of this miserable blacksmith.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.120
Helpless,
he tosses his head back and forth.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.760
Screaming in fear and pain.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.000
Eventually
his all-consuming screams die down.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.480
And when the flames' dance ends,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.200
nothing but a charred, mute lump
is left behind.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.800
Now you can open your eyes again.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.280
See?

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.760
The images you create in your mind

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.040
are often more powerful
than the real thing.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.120
Those mental images should
motivate you to work even harder

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.360
to give me something better than these

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.440
piece-of-shit hands.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.760
Now get to work!

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.040
By Loki!

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.400
Cause of death?

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.240
I think most likely the boulder.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.360
Yeah, you think?

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.560
And the motive is probably the map.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.960
Yeah, maybe.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.960
There isn't much else here
shim could be after.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.520
Shim?

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.840
It's impossible to see
if it's a man or a woman,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.960
so I thought it would be best
to say shim.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.200
In order to not step on any toes.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.840
Yeah.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.280
I wonder who's behind this.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.360
Or maybe shim wanted the map

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.640
for shimself?

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.440
I would think Jarl Varg is behind it.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.160
He's been itching for that map
for quite some time.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.040
Yeah, but he said we were even, so...

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.760
Hi.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.600
-Hi.
-Good thing the trap worked.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.480
You can't just come
and steal maps from us.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.120
No.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.120
I think this whole
"taking a break" stuff sucks.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.560
Can't we just forget about this?

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.040
We both want it.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.800
Even if Liv is back,
she can't rule over us.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.720
The last few days

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.400
have been horrible.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.920
I haven't slept since...

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.680
Since we took the break.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.680
-Me neither.
-You haven't?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.840
Well, I have.
But it feels like I haven't.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.440
I haven't eaten since.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.120
Except for yesterday.
I had a big dinner.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.120
I had no choice.
I was so hungry.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.480
Hey...
Can't we just say it's you and me?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.280
The two of us, together?

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.920
You and me...

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.400
But we can rape when we pillage, right?

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.560
Yeah, sure.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.320
Any reason for disturbing my meal?

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.840
My apologies, but the master thief
who was supposed to retrieve the map

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.120
was killed.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.760
Crushed like a bug.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.880
So my cunning plan failed?

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.320
You could say that.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.520
Midriff.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.440
Temple.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.320
That was great.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.280
Sometimes it just builds up
inside of me.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.200
You want some porridge?

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.160
I love porridge!

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.400
Arvid?

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.200
What do you think you're doing,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.440
barging in like that?

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.720
Is this what you want?

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.240
No, or...

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.200
Is this really what you want?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.080
That your own son, the sole heir
to this village, should grow up in a tent?

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.120
Kicked out by his own father?

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.840
Because he didn't have
big enough testicles

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.960
to face up to his witch of a wife?

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.320
I'd be a little careful now,
if I were you.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.400
Arvid...

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.520
You have to choose if you want
to continue your life with a son

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.640
who doesn't want anything else
but your love.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.880
-Give me a break!
-Or...

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.480
If you want to banish him forever.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.040
Alone.
Forsaken.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.400
With no hope.
No future.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.400
Arvid...

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.480
This is your decision.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.800
The most important decision
you will ever make.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.480
Well...

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.240
The thing is, we kind of decided...

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.320
Because Liv thinks...

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.160
Or I, I think...

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.640
We both, as a team,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.320
think...

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.480
That.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.240
Hormones.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.840
Loki...

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.040
There you are!

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.720
I hardly recognized you without
your heads dripping with fresh urine.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.840
Real mature, Hildur.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.160
Pee, poo and fart jokes
are the worst jokes of all.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.600
-Humor is subjective.
-Yeah, but that joke has no layers.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.240
And it's hurtful.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.720
For your information, I feel offended now.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.080
Great.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.680
Anyway, I need you to get me something.
I need a rabbit, a sack and a bowl.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.080
Oh?

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.480
Well, I need
acceptable sanitary conditions,

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.760
challenging lyrical poetry and
something other than subhumans around me.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.200
But I don't go around
nagging others about it.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.480
Rufus and Orm, you're slaves.
Your job is to do whatever we tell you to.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.760
And now I need a rabbit,
a sack and a bowl.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.200
Yes, OK.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.960
Or I'll have your ball-sacks whipped.
And I mean that literally.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.400
You're literally!

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.240
They say the first thing

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.040
that goes when you lose your hands,
are your fine motor skills.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.640
Could very well be.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.400
Look at me!

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.680
I can't even drown defenseless kittens.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.000
Pathetic!

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.840
But

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.560
anyone can walk around with hands.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.840
It's the easiest thing in the world.
Even small babies have hands.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.600
It's when you don't have any hands,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.120
new things start happening.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.800
That's when it gets exciting.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.840
Stop the flattery!

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.880
Sorry.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.320
Anything in particular?

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.760
Arvid is smarter than I thought.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.560
We tried to take the map by force.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.680
We tried through cunning.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.240
It's time to play our last card.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.720
Treason!

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.720
I'm talking about a man on the inside.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.320
I'm talking about

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.360
high treason!

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.440
Hi, guys!

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.160
There you are.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.560
Hi, Orm.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.080
I'll just take a hug.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.600
[coos to bunny]

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.520
No socializing today either?

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.080
This is a pretty lame gang, Kark.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.640
Everybody is so exhausted.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.720
But it's important to have some
social interaction as well, not only work.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.600
You bond in a completely different way
when you meet in a different setting.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.160
Yeah, that would be lovely,
but maybe some other day?

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.920
But we really should try to do that.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.600
We should.
You know, I'm going to take care of this.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.160
And I'm not going to quit until
every one of us is sitting around a fire,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.800
barbecuing and enjoying
each other's company.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.080
That sounds super.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.720
I'm already
looking forward to it, Orm.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.840
-Nighty-night, Karky.
-Good night, Orm.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.000
-Good night, Rufus.
-Shut it!

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.080
[low voices and laughter]

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.840
[hearty laughter]

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.840
Seriously?

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.160
You're having an after-work mead
without me?

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.000
You know, I was the driving force

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.480
behind this exact concept.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.800
No, this was totally accidental.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.200
I mean, I just had to get up and pee.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.600
I think all of you
also had to just get up and pee.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.440
I was just airing my old cunt craver.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.840
And I was just airing my... fur burger.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.080
Yeah, so this was kind of
a spontaneous thing. It's nothing planned.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.480
You all know that the spontaneous things

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.640
are the ones
that turn out to be the most fun!

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.880
Maybe because we have lower expectations
and you can relax a bit more.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:15.040
So it's just pouring salt into the wound
saying that it was spontaneous.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.160
Sorry about that.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.080
Kark.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.840
My best friend and workmate,
sneaking out like this?

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.600
We're practically blood brothers.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.680
Either you are blood brothers,
or you are not.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.080
Do you know why we don't take you
on these social activities?

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.080
No, honestly, I don't.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.000
OK, it's because if you were here,

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.520
we would all be sitting and
having to listen to your boring anecdotes

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.440
and fables.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.480
My anecdotes are nothing
but extremely interesting.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.240
-No, they are not.
-Odd, please...

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.640
Nobody here is interested
in what you have dreamt

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.840
and what your dreams might mean.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.000
It's extremely boring.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.080
You know what?
All of you in general,

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.680
and you specifically, Kark,

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.400
you have hurt me more than anyone
has ever hurt anybody, ever.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.840
I'm really sorry.
I...

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.040
No!
After a long and strenuous journey,

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.360
you have just reached the peak
of Mount Hurtfulness.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.240
You have climbed to the pinnacle
of the Hurt Tree.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.600
You've shattered the hurt ceiling.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.480
And I hope that you
are proud of yourselves.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.240
-Come on, Orm. Just come here. Sit down.
-No, no.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.480
Take part in the festivities.
I mean, I saved a rat drumstick for you.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.920
-It's too late.
-Orm...

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.720
Being excluded by the ones
who are at the bottom

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.400
of the social ladder, the subhumans...

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.760
Orm...

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.760
No, no.
It's too late.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.760
Too late.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.080
That would be kind of nice.
Maybe just some have some dinner.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.880
Why not?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.160
Hope you're happy now.
I gave birth alone in the forest.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.160
But before I even got to hold
the little prince,

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.640
a wolf came and snatched him away.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.960
Oh, no.
Think if it was my son!

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.200
Was it a... plump boy?

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.080
-A corpulent baby?
-With a curved spine?

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.640
Thanks for all the support!

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.600
I imagine Thor and Odin
will be very pleased with you.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.440
-Really? You think so?
-For Loki's sake, Arvid!

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.080
Thor and Odin will not be pleased
with you. That was irony.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.440
-Never heard of it.
-It's a brand new linguistic tool. Anyway.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.560
You're both going to end up in disfavor
for having killed a chieftain's son.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.040
Especially you, Liv.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.880
Since you were the driving force
behind this... baby killing.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.680
No!

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.680
Sorry to have brought you here by force,
but you wouldn't have come willingly.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.040
-Huh?
-I said I'm sorry that I brought you...

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.400
Whatever.
Orm.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.600
You and I have a mutual enemy.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.240
An enemy that keeps us from our destiny.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.480
-Kark?
-No.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.160
Arvid.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.800
He's keeping you
from your rightful throne.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.200
And he's keeping me
from my rightful map.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.440
I see...

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.400
And you think
we can do something about that?

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.320
I don't know.
Arvid is so powerful.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.880
I think it's very risky.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.560
Orm, sometimes
you have to drop your shield

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.960
and attack with both

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.280
hands.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.880
Meet me here

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.080
in the light of the next full moon.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.920
And I will give you everything you need
in order for us to be victorious.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.800
That sounds great!

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.840
Excellent.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.960
Excellent.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.320
But I...

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.080
Hello?

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.120
I see you.
I saw you when you took the cape.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.400
I can see you down that little hill.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.880
Yeah.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.800
I have some big news.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.920
I'm going to be chieftain again.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.600
-Chieftain?
-Yes, and I have big plans for you too.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.480
But first I need you to join me
in doing something gruesome.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.280
I'm in.
On one condition.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.920
That I can return home to Rome
at the first possible opportunity.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.200
OK, people.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.920
Then there are three blacksmiths left.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.800
The next one out has come all the way
from the county of Vestfold.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.880
Exciting.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.400
I... haven't seen what's been made before.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.520
So it's kind of like
shooting from the hip.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.080
But people in Vestfold
were very impressed.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.640
With this one you can eat.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.960
Like normal.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.960
And

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.520
this one

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.280
should function like a regular hand.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.240
Just with slightly stiffer fingers?

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.040
Next, Torstein.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.800
No, no.
You go.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.760
-You have been here before.
-Yes.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.960
I hope you've got something better
this time.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.320
Oh, yes.
I'm pleased myself, so...

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.560
Right.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.040
I give you something cutting edge.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.080
Prostheses

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.080
in three... dimensions.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.000
And next, Torstein.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.720
Eh...

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.360
Your stumps, if I may.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.240
Fantastic.
This is really great.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.480
Wow!

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.840
And it's not just good design.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.120
They have a hidden secret.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.760
Secrets?
Ah, secrets!

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.680
Shadow play.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.480
Puzzles.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.360
Perfect...

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.000
[wolf howls]

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.040
There you are!

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.960
We have put together
a fairly foolproof plan,

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.520
which I think you are...

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.880
Is something wrong?

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.000
Do I have something in my teeth?

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.640
It's good to see you again.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.400
We didn't get a proper goodbye last time.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.760
You don't remember?

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.600
Just drop the masquerade, Hound.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.760
What are you talking about?

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.600
-You came inside me.
-Came inside you?

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.240
I think you may be confusing me with...

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.400
You remember me better now?

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.560
"Yes, come on!"

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.200
"Come on, come on!"

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.880
No!

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.480
No...

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.840
No.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.240
Torstein, Torstein...

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.000
Let me share some wise words with you

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.960
that will turn these feelings that
you're experiencing now, upside down.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.840
It's not the sexual organ
you fall in love with,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.160
but the person it's on.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.040
You don't develop feelings

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.840
for the cavernous body itself
or the vulva.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.160
So you mustn't be so hard on yourself,
Hound.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.600
You just need to learn
the art of surrendering.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.480
Accept your urges and your emotions.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.480
In a few years time, what we did will
probably be accepted here in Norway too.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.760
We just need a couple of strong fellows
to lead the way.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.160
-That won't be us.
-It fits. Back there.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.080
Like a dagger in a scabbard.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.400
-I mean...
-Wait. I'm going to stop you right there.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.200
Because I know exactly
what you're going to say.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.160
But the timing isn't right.
It can't be us.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.960
Not now.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.560
We have a job to do.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.640
If you could just shut up
for a couple of minutes,

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.320
I'll tell you the plan.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.480
Good.
Finally.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.240
[knock on door]

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.160
Yes?

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.360
Orm.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.560
What can I do for you?

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.840
You are an extremely capable warrior,
but you have one weakness.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.920
You're allergic to wasps, is that right?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.280
Yes, that allergy
is my one Achilles heel, Orm.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.000
How does that allergy manifest itself,
specifically?

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.560
Well actually, one single wasp sting

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.280
can lead to a serious reaction.
In the worst case, death.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.040
Why are you so curious
about my wasp allergy?

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.160
No specific reason.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.000
Are you still of the opinion
that I should be a slave

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.440
for the rest of your life?

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.120
-Yes, of course.
-Yes.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.280
Then I guess maybe

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.560
this is where your journey ends.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.480
Journey?

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.080
No, no, no, no!

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.200
[screams from inside]

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.680
Do your thing.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.160
[angry wasps]

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.600
Raise your shield.
Ørn?

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.120
Arvid!

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.720
-Something's happened to the Lawspeaker.
-What?

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.680
I don't know.
He's barely breathing.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.400
We need to go.
Come on!

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.800
-What's going on, good people?
-The Lawspeaker is badly hurt.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.520
Is he dead?

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.440
Huh?

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.960
-No.
-No? Good.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.520
-Good.
-That's good.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.920
Yeah...

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.840
Didn't you make sure he was dead?

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.200
That was not my responsibility.
That was your job!

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.160
Loki!
Come!

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.440
Come on!
