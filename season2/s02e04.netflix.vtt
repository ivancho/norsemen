WEBVTT

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.600
Wasps?

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.240
I didn't know the Lawspeaker
was so fond of honey.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.200
Arvid!

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.840
Wait!

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.320
Do not go in there!

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.040
Maybe it's best that I sacrifice myself
and go in first.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.600
The sight waiting you in there
may traumatize you for life.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.520
OK?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.720
Or maybe it's not traumatizing at all,
you know. I've never been in there.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.560
What the Helheim has happened here?

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.960
Lawspeaker?
Lawspeaker!

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.320
Lawspeaker!

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.880
I don't even know his real name.
I've always called him Lawspeaker.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.920
Why are you guys here, anyway?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.080
He was just like

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.720
a guy in the village
where I grew up, to me.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.080
So it's important to be here
on his final journey.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.240
Traitor...

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.040
Hm?

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.800
Traitor...

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.320
Yes, see you later.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.520
See you later.
On the other side.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.480
Treason...

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.600
Reason?
There is no reason to any of this.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.760
-He's saying "treason," isn't he?
-No, "reason."

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.400
It was Or...

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.920
I just went ahead and did it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.920
So you wouldn't have to be burdened
by a mercy killing.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.240
I took one for the team.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.320
This will haunt me for the rest of my
life, but I've put him out of his misery.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.720
And sent him off
to his final resting place.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.280
Heaven has gotten a new star.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.640
Wait, wait!

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.520
It looks like
he was clasping something.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.160
I wonder what it was
that was so important to him.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.880
I'll take these.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.000
Has he written anything, perhaps?
Maybe some final words?

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.680
The Lawspeaker's word is law.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.520
So whatever is written is truly important.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.680
"Today is an exciting day."

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.920
"I will release

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.120
a wasp swarm in my hut."

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.840
"To test if I'm still

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.840
allergic."

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.200
Wow.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.000
That's a strange choice,
for someone who is that allergic.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.320
You know, people are different.
Some like to challenge themselves.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.960
Experiment.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.880
"If something should happen to me,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.400
I command that

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.760
the next Lawspeaker in Norheim

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.720
shall be a man

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.320
of superior

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.680
intellectual capacity."

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.280
"Rufus of Rome."

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.240
What?!

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.200
Well...

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.120
"I realize

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.200
I have committed

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.400
a grave injustice

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.640
regarding Orm."

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.480
True.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.240
"My last command is that Orm

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.840
shall no longer be a slave."

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.600
Oh my Thor, that's insane!

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.080
Don't scoff at his dead body, Ragnar.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.560
Those were the dying words
of Norheim's most respected man.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.400
-His word is law.
-Yeah, unfortunately.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.920
It looks like something else
is written there as well.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.040
"Orm shall actively be included

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.760
in all social contexts."

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.040
Well, Arvid, Frøya...

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.920
Ragnar...

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.120
I guess the tables have turned again.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.360
-The tables have turned?
-Yes.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.920
Well, maybe not turned
completely around, but maybe...

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.800
The tables are at least

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.720
slightly angled.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.600
Well, at least I am a free man.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.120
And Frøya, I guess that means
that we are married again.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.840
-What?!
-No! Forget about it. No, no.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.560
Rufus, how does that work in practice?

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.400
You are the new Lawspeaker now,
so your word is law.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.480
Thank you. I will look into it
so I can render a qualified decision.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.520
Based on the relevant sources of law.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.440
That's good.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.560
The rat pack.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.400
Hey, guys.
Just in time for dinner.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.120
-We're just here to pick up our things.
-Huh?

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.400
And to inform you
that we're superhumans now.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.360
And you're still subhumans.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.960
I'm a free man
and Rufus is the new Lawspeaker.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.880
Wow, that's great!
Congratulations.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.040
Yield your hand!

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.760
Your nasty hand.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.360
Yield my hand?
Is that what it's called?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.440
Yes, it is.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.400
And any form of fellowship
is more unlikely now than ever.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.520
In reality, as of now, I'm the most
powerful man in the village.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.440
And I'm soon to be chieftain again.
And when that happens,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.040
Rufus is going to sail our ship to Rome!

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.240
Orm?

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.760
Keep quiet!

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.720
You don't tell secret plans
to Odin and everyone.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.480
That's rule of thumb number one.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.400
Sorry, I just got a little carried away.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.160
-Yes, but...
-Yes.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.240
-Keep your mouth shut.
-Shut.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.080
Orm is not going to be chieftain.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.440
We have an excellent chieftain in Arvid.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.560
And we are not thinking
about overthrowing him.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.920
And we would like to express
our full and utter faith

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.600
in Arvid.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.200
But don't think I've forgotten

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.320
how you failed me and froze me out.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.440
Winter is coming for the three of you!

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.360
Winter cometh, perhaps?
No. Winter is coming.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.400
Winter is coming!

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.160
The time has come to formally appoint
our new Lawspeaker.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.200
Yes, question?

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.120
Am I the only one
who finds this a little strange?

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.040
What do you mean?

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.520
I mean like the Lawspeaker
writing down his last wishes,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.240
and then suddenly dying.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.720
I mean, it seems like something taken
straight out of a crime rune stick.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.680
If so, that would have been a pretty
ordinary and boring crime rune stick.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.080
Because that's so normal.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.800
It's common.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.680
No, it isn't, Orm.
It's very suspicious.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.640
Hildur, this was Odin's plan.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.600
And honey, it would look better

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.160
if you would be happy
about what is about to happen.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.400
Instead of being caught up in the past.
It doesn't become you.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.560
Hm?

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.280
Sweetheart, you would actually
be quite attractive

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.560
if you weren't so caught up
in the recent past

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.680
and wanting to unravel things
and question everything.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.440
But now you're throwing it all away.
It's sad.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.040
It's actually a sad sight.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.640
No wonder she's single.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.400
Nobody wants to be around
a nosy parker.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.920
Well.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.880
Somebody had to tell her, right?

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.120
The Lawspeaker's hat

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.440
is a big hat to fill.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.560
So I hope you will bear this
with dignity.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.720
I hereby declare Rufus

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.400
as Norheim's new Lawspeaker!

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.120
The first thing I choose to do
as legislative and judiciary authority,

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.280
is to make wearing the Lawspeaker's hat
optional for the Lawspeaker!

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.280
[gasps]

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.280
Especially a hat as full of lice
and vermin as that one.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.360
And the old Lawspeaker
should get a burial

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.160
worthy of a man of his standing.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.800
We shall hold nothing back.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.680
Everybody has to give

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.600
their most prized possessions
and send them off to Valhalla with him.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.120
So... give till it hurts.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.320
You know, in Vestfold they've started

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.280
burying big shots in ships now.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.200
Huh?

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.800
Yeah, they bury entire ships

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.160
full of all kinds of nice things.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.760
You know, the ship is our

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.040
most valuable asset.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.960
And it would probably hurt the most.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.160
Yeah, I think we'd be
a little wing-clipped

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.960
as Vikings, without a Viking ship.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.200
It would really suck for everybody,
but you said we should give till it hurts.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.560
So maybe we should just do it, then?

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.400
The ship shall not be buried.
That's for elite funerals.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.040
Chieftains.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.600
And artists.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.240
Rufus?

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.840
Great decision about the ship.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.200
It would have been so much hassle
to build a new one.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.360
Yes, it was a wise
and correct decision.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.440
I just hope the Lawspeaker
was right about you.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.680
I know we have had our disagreements.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.720
I just want us to leave it all behind us
and make the best out of this.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.400
Absolutely, Arvid. We are going
to make the best out of this. Absolutely.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.760
Great.
You know what?

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.840
I have a good feeling about you.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.320
I think you and I can be a good team.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.040
[moans of pain]

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.360
You know, Arvid, the thing about me...

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.080
My body is my rune stick
and my tattoos are my saga.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.600
Yeah?
That's cool.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.560
It's like I've always said:

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.920
Show me a man with a tattoo, and I'll
show you a man with an interesting story.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.760
But it seems like everyone
has tattoos these days.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.760
So does that mean everyone
has an interesting story?

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.960
Well, with me,
I'm like a canvas of my experiences.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.960
My story is etched in lines and shadows.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.640
And you can read it on my arms,
my shoulders,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.480
my back, my stomach, my legs even.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.480
So what is the story
behind those lines, anyway?

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.400
These? They are a reminder
of all the women I've had.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.520
What?!

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.400
-That's a lot!
-Yeah, it's quite a few.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.440
I mean, that must be about every woman

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.320
in a 20-mile radius from here.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.960
Yeah, but they're not only
physical penetrations, Arvid.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.520
Hm?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.920
Two of them are physical.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.080
And the rest are fantasy penetrations.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.480
Hm?

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.400
You know, when I've "worked myself."

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.840
So you have tattooed a line

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.920
for each time you've stroked your sword?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.800
No, no. Only the hand jobs
I want to remember.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.800
So I can look back and reminisce.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.920
They're like small pages
in the saga of Ragnar, in a way.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.800
-You know?
-Yeah. It's cool.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.280
Yeah, I know.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.640
That looks really good!

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.680
Yeah?
You think so?

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.280
Tattoos show that you're an interesting
person with an exciting story.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.880
Yeah, the other guys said
I needed some more ink.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.800
Loki if I know.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.480
It's supposed to be me and Frøya
on the battlefield.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.200
You don't think it's a bit iffy to have
a big tattoo of Frøya on your back,

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.680
when you're still married to Liv?

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.960
No, that will sort out.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.440
And then it will be Frøya and me forever,
no matter what.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.000
-You think so?
-Yeah. Some things you just know.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.360
What brings you here, anyway?

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.560
I just came to tell you that Rufus and Orm

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.520
came by the slave camp
to get their things.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.840
And they were acting
real high and mighty.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.200
Yeah, now that Rufus
has become Lawspeaker, I'm not surprised.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.080
Sure, sure. But Orm actually said
he was going to be chieftain.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.080
-He said that?
-Mhm.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.040
Yeah, I think they're up to something.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.160
They have some sinister plans.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.800
I don't mean to stress you out,
but I'm a bit concerned.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.080
But don't they say that nine
out of ten concerns are unwarranted?

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.160
Yeah.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.440
One shouldn't get hung up on concerns.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.920
That is true.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.320
But thanks for telling me, anyway.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.840
You know, Kark,

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.200
you're the best subhuman I've ever owned.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.200
-Wow!
-Yeah.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.040
That's...
That's overwhelming.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.960
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.680
-See you at the funeral.
-Yeah, see you.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.000
Ow!

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.760
Loki!

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.560
[woman sobbing]

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.320
Torstein?
What are you doing here?

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.240
I come to pay my condolences.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.480
Pay your condolences?

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.080
Is that what you say?

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.680
-I guess so.
-OK...

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.800
Jarl Varg sends his...

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.680
Sympathies?
Sympathetics?

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.880
Sympathies, I think.
Thank you.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.240
I'm sorry to be so formal,

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.120
but funerals are so difficult.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.120
What's the right thing to say?

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.960
Can you smile
when you meet some old friends?

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.640
Things like that.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.480
It isn't easy.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.320
I guess there's no right and wrong
in these situations.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.760
The important thing is that you show up.
Thank you.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.240
Mostly coins.
With some rocks and stuff on the bottom.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.600
Just to make it feel a bit heavy.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.440
It's fine.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.880
It seems like the first

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.840
domino has fallen.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.400
Don't rule out

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.320
that the Arvid domino is the next to fall.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.480
What's "domino"?

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.880
Domino is some kind of game.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.280
Varg got it from this merchant
from somewhere out in the boonies.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.440
OK.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.040
And if you line up the pieces,
you can trigger some kind of

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.040
chain reaction.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.240
Where one piece falls after another.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.280
Loki if I know.
I was just told to say that to you.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.800
Am I supposed to know
what a chain reaction is?

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.680
Do people walk around
knowing these things?

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.400
All I know
is what I was told to say to you.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.800
And now I've said it.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.040
So I guess it's up to you,

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.880
how you interpret it.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.240
But I don't know what to interpret.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.360
But I...

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.200
I told you.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.120
I don't know it any better than you.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.640
I'm...

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.280
I'm sending a message.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.760
What Varg told me to say.
And now I've said it.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.600
But I'm sure you know the essence
of what you're talking about.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.720
So is that a threat, or what is it?

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.240
Well, I guess it is a threat, yeah.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.480
I'm pretty sure of that.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.600
Have you planned any...

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.560
Any type of

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.520
food gathering?

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.160
Snacks gathering?
After the ceremony?

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.120
Yeah, we'll have a gathering.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.160
For the closest family.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.000
And friends.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.400
OK.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.360
Well, I was supposed to go anyway.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.000
It's... getting late.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.240
See you.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.880
Oh great Odin!

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.600
Please welcome the Lawspeaker

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.000
to Valhalla.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.360
Dig.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.440
-Just some quick input.
-Yes?

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.840
Shouldn't we send
some slaves with him, as well?

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.880
What do you mean?

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.520
The Lawspeaker could use some slaves
on his journey to Valhalla.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.080
As consolation for not getting a ship.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.280
Yes, that's a great suggestion.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.280
I'm thinking

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.240
all three.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.960
No, we can't send all three.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.920
We need Kark

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.800
to dig the burial mound.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.440
OK.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.200
You two.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.560
Cheer up! It's one of
the greatest honors for a subhuman.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.640
To be buried
next to a respected Lawspeaker.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.680
-Can we eat some of the fruit?
-No, of course not.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.080
That's human food,
for his journey to Valhalla.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.680
Kark?

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.440
Good luck in Helheim!

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.520
I hear they have an own department
for excluders.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.200
We don't believe in Helheim or Valhalla.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.760
So this trip is going to be a total waste,
as far as I'm concerned.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.640
Yeah, I mean, I'm a Christian,
if you've heard of that.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.720
I believe in Jesus from Nazareth.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.200
So this really doesn't
make any sense to me.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.600
Well, you'll just have to bite
your tongues.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.360
Now lie down!

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.760
You know, it's just so totally against
my self-preservation instincts.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.760
To lie down here

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.320
and be buried like this.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.320
Kark?
Beat hand!

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.880
Beat

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.920
hand.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.160
Allow me!

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.200
Well, well, well, Kark.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.000
The Tree of Exclusion bears bitter fruit.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.800
What?

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.240
I'm just saying that I'm not a man
you should exclude from social activities.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.080
You missed one Friday-night mead,
and this is how you react?

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.000
Those are my friends in there.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.120
No, they were your friends, Kark.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.040
They were the ones you'd rather
drink and barbecue with than me.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.000
I've apologized for that.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.760
Well, you know,
times are going to change around here.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.800
And then it won't be so easy being Kark.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.280
But it's never been easy for me.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.000
I'm utterly impoverished.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.000
Just look at me. I'm 18 years old
and I look like I'm well over 40.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.440
Well, anyway.
There is a funeral feast

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.480
and you are not invited.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.880
Or, no.
We need you to wait tables.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.320
So I guess I'll see you there.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.680
OK.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.520
There are so many erogenous zones
on the body.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.720
So my latest discovery

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.360
is a walnut-sized gland in your colon
that is extremely erogenous.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.120
It gives you pleasure
like nothing you'd believe.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.880
It's like having Thor himself up in...

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.160
We just talked about it.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.640
Have you read those law...

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.080
-Sources.
-The law sources about marriage?

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.080
If it still applies, if one spouse

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.640
has become an outlaw.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.560
Because then it doesn't, does it?

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.640
That.
Yes. Right.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.320
It turns out

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.400
that when the outlaw is freed,

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.080
the marriage is still valid.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.280
Huh?

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.920
That's excellent, Frøya!

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.120
Then I can crawl into the crook of
your arm tonight. It's been so long.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.200
No, you're not gonna do that.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.240
I just have to insist
that you cut your hair short.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.160
It's about time.
Preferably crew cut!

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.920
Frøya.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.680
We'll work this out.
There has to be some solution.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.640
I just can't be married to Orm anymore.
There's no way.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.520
I understand that,
but apparently that's how the rules work.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.680
But there has to be something we can do.
I mean...

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.120
I have a strong feeling that everything
will work out when we get to the thing.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.800
If we can just stick it out until then,
everything will be OK.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.000
Why do you think that?

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.160
Because good things
happen to good people.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.880
And we're good.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.760
You and I.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.600
Wow.
Sure is crowded here today.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.160
Yeah.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.480
-It stops here, Arvid.
-Hm?

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.960
You heard me.
It stops here.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.120
No more "protection money."

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.480
There has to be,
or else you won't be protected anymore.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.120
And then anything can happen.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.840
Well, what you see here, Arvid,

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.000
is a peasant army.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.280
This is a grass-roots rebellion.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.400
This rebellion will spread.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.160
And when we're finished,
we will have a new form of government.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.080
OK?

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.120
The people shall decide.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.320
Not a power elite

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.680
that exploits the weak

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.560
with weapons and superior force.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.680
I see.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.000
The time is long overdue.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.160
We demand majority decisions

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.680
by democratically-elected

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.360
bodies.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.840
Well, that sounds pretty solid.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.400
Or what do you say, Frøya?

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.400
Yeah, I think it's great.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.600
Yeah.
I've been waiting for this.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.560
I mean,
I think we should give Eigil that thing.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.240
Yeah, I think he deserves it now.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.520
But where did I put it?

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.600
-Didn't you pack it on the horse?
-I think I saw it over there.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.520
Yeah?
OK.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.840
Yeah...

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.240
Ah, it's here!

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.200
OK.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.560
What is...?

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.960
Is it just a fist, or...

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.800
Ah, is it a symbol

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.600
of the power of the people?
Huh?

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.000
Great.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.680
Right in the solar plexus.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.640
-Stand still.
-Ow!

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.440
-Yeah, yeah.
-Don't!

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.280
Do we agree
that this peasant revolt is over?

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.720
Yeah.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.160
Absolutely.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.040
I think you might have
underestimated our profession here,

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.440
if you think you can simply
become warriors instead of farmers.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.400
Yeah.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.480
I'm sorry if we maybe took
a little too much.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.600
But we're going to the thing,
so we're going to need a little extra.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.120
Yeah, I understand.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.160
-Excellent. All right, see you later.
-Yeah, see you later.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.360
Yeah.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.120
I'll see you.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.800
Before you know it!
