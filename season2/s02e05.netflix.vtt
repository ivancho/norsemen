WEBVTT

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.760
The day has come to bring down a tyrant!

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.760
Our lives are not worth living

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.880
if we don't have our freedom!

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.720
Let's show Arvid
that he may take our lives,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.360
but he can never take our freedom!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.920
I mean, that whole thing about freedom

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.480
does not apply to you slaves, OK?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.720
You are a breed of subhumans.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.440
And the whole thing about freedom

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.800
and the value of that,
that does not apply to you.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.320
Where was I?

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.480
Yeah.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.480
What we do in this life,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.000
echoes in eternity!

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.400
Death to Arvid!

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.480
[small talk]

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.760
-Orm.
-Hm?

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.800
Just lay low, OK?

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.920
Let the plan unfold.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.920
Yes.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.200
I'm just so excited.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.600
Yeah, I understand. But it's
very important just to stay focused.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.320
Because we are so near our goal.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.520
I can practically smell Rome.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.000
Rome...

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.840
The city that never sleeps.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.040
Yes.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.760
OK.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.000
They're here any minute now, so...

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.120
I guess you can lead the attack.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.640
Yeah. I mean, the commander
leads the attack. Yes.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.480
Yeah, so...

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.800
Are you going to set up a perimeter
and form a front?

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.960
Or what's your plan?

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.760
Hm?

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.200
Eh...
Your plan.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.240
Well, no, I'm...

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.040
I'm the type of leader who, you know,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.440
leads from further back.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.760
That, you know,
gives me a better perspective.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.720
I can see the bigger picture, kind of.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.160
I think the commander
is supposed to be at the front.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.920
Yeah?
Actually no, not in a peasant army.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.240
In a peasant army,
the commander is expected to have

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.440
a more passive role.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.360
-OK?
-Yeah.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.640
You realize you sort of have
a target on your back, right?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.720
What do you mean?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.200
Well, you're new as a chieftain

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.560
and people might want to test you,
Jarl Varg and such people.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.480
Yeah, I've thought about it.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.840
I'll just keep my distance from Varg.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.120
-Then everything should be all right.
-OK?

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.040
It's like I always say:

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.360
Keep your friends close,
and your enemies a little farther away.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.360
Frøya, why don't you walk a while
back here, with your husband?

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.400
We're discussing allocations of tents,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.040
and I told them
that we definitely want to sleep together.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.560
OK, I'll just be in the back here,
if you need me.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.360
So you're just going to stay here
in hiding? That's your plan?

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.960
No!

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.040
Everyone attacks when I blow this horn.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.560
That's the plan.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.400
Everyone but you.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.720
You know what?
If you make sure you spend

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.120
anywhere near as much energy
on this ambush

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.600
as you do now
criticizing your commander,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.880
this whole thing will go just great.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.000
Arvid and his gang won't stand a chance.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.640
So go find your place!

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.360
Huh?
Can you believe it?

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.400
Comes up here and tries to lecture me
on how to organize a peasant revolt?

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.640
I mean, I invented the peasant revolt!

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.560
Lecturing me...
I'm lecturing him!

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.760
[barely audible horn]

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.000
Man down!

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.040
Shield wall!

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.800
Man down!

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.680
We're sitting ducks here!

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.680
Let me in!

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.280
Two lines!

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.200
Now!

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.040
I need a medicine man!

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.680
Were we just attacked?

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.680
Kind of seemed like it.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.080
Orm?

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.320
Arvid...

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.920
I'm so sorry.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.120
For everything.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.920
I'll see you on the other side.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.320
Forgive me.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.320
Well, don't just stand there!
Save him!

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.920
Save him!

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.160
Hang in there, Orm.
It's gonna be OK.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.080
I don't think there's much
that needs to be saved.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.680
What?

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.000
They didn't exactly use

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.040
live arrows.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.920
Just the fact that it didn't cross their
minds that arrows need to be pointed.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.560
I'm disappointed.
Orm, wake up.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.320
No...

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.600
No, but I was seriously hit.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.160
A mortal wound to the heart.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.760
That's just...

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.520
It's so low.
It's sad.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.760
I knew something strange was going on.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.520
I got hit by many arrows,
but nothing happened.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.560
Me too.
I felt immortal there for a moment.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.360
Seriously, I think I was gone

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.720
for a few seconds.
It's like I was floating...

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.640
-You were sleeping.
-No, no.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.560
If it isn't Eigil.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.200
Congrats on a great peasant revolt.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.600
I told you.
Waging war is a profession.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.120
Arvid, I'm the first to admit that...

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.120
That you were right.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.680
I mean,
the art of war is not for everyone.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.800
So this will not happen again.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.880
No.
It won't.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.520
No...

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.920
Ragnar.
Ørn.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.000
What's the point of this?
You've won already!

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.160
Arvid, this is the stupidest thing
you can do.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.800
And why is that?

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.280
Just because I'm the last surviving farmer
for miles around.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.200
If something happens to me,
you will die of hunger.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.600
Who's gonna give you food?

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.640
Who's gonna teach new farmers?
I mean, you have only me.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.480
He's got a point.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.040
Yeah.
I do.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.800
Arvid.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.320
If you look around,
you will see that I'm actually

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.680
the most important person here.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.560
Ahem.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.960
Huh?

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.840
Let's go.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.680
Yes!

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.280
Hi there.
Good to see you.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.440
Good to see you.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.920
Nice to see you.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.280
We are gathered here

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.480
for this meeting of the landsthing .

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.760
We come in peace.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.840
And we leave

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.560
in peace.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.320
Whomsoever violates

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.280
this thing-peace

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.160
will be declared

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.880
an outlaw.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.200
Those who seek

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.040
to resolve disputes,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.040
are asked to turn them in

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.880
now.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.000
And I hereby declare

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.800
this thing open!

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.560
Frøya?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.000
Can you

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.840
tickle my arm a little?

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.160
Ain't gonna happen.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.960
No.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.400
So.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.040
I talked to the Thingman.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.480
And it turns out that you, Arvid,
have been summoned.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.320
-By Jarl Varg.
-What for?

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.960
He wants to lay claim to that map.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.680
But I wouldn't worry.
You have a pretty solid case.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.840
Yeah, I hope so.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.480
-Just don't let Varg get to you.
-Of course.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.880
If we violate the thing-peace,
we're in trouble.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.760
I'll be cool as a cucumber.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.520
You'll never get me agitated.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.840
I actually have as a principle
never getting agitated.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.560
But it's important you don't
come across as weak, either.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.240
Don't let them run you over.
There's room for temperament.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.440
Temperature is only healthy.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.480
Just follow your instincts, Arvid,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.520
and I'm sure this is going to be
totally painless.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.200
-Be yourself.
-Everyone else is taken.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.840
Arvid?

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.960
Just one thing.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.760
-What are you doing?
-I gave you the Judas kiss.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.960
-The what?
-The Judas kiss.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.720
It's what Judas Iscariot
gave Jesus from Nazareth.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.600
As a death sentence
and a definitive and final goodbye.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.440
It was almost 800 years ago,
so no wonder you hadn't heard about it.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.520
That was gross.
That is not OK.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.760
That's almost sexual harassment.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.120
Orm.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.560
Don't tell him that.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.280
He might get suspicious.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.440
But if I hadn't told him, he would
have thought it was just a regular kiss.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.280
Yes, but...

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.200
First

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.760
to the dispute between Jarl Varg

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.800
and chieftain Arvid of Norheim.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.200
Regarding a promise given to Jarl Varg

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.240
by the deceased chieftain Olav.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.000
Varg?

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.080
This is correct, your honor.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.200
Chieftain Olav
was sent on a mission by me

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.960
to find a route to the West.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.320
I was promised
that a map would be drawn up.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.040
And handed over to me.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.920
What do you have to say to that, Arvid?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.520
What Jarl Varg says is true.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.560
They had an agreement.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.120
Then

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.240
Varg attacked Norheim.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.440
And they ended up raping

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.480
the chieftain at the time.
Orm.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.480
And you just don't rape chieftains

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.120
and demand maps in return.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.960
That's just wrong.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.560
At least that's my opinion.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.920
-Is this true?
-Objection, your honor.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.560
It may have started out as chieftain rape.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.680
But the tables suddenly turned.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.720
So that the chieftain

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.720
actually became the active part.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.000
-OK?
-Yes.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.160
The chieftain used fingers and tongue

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.080
and counter-humped so violently

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.960
that he went from

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.280
"ravishee" to "ravisher."

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.000
I think maybe that's enough.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.600
So if anyone is to be accused
of being raped,

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.040
it has to be the original rapist.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.520
Yes, because
I actually ended up raping him.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.520
With my

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.280
anus.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.440
So the answer to whether
the chieftain of Norheim was raped,

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.920
is a resounding no.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.720
Fine.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.080
-That sounds plausible.
-Absolutely.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.920
But, Jarl Varg,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.600
did you attack Norheim?

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.880
That's the only thing
we really need to know here.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.000
Well, I suppose
some parts of it are true.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:34.800
There were some disagreements
and some fairly gruesome murders.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.920
Allow us to confer.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.960
And we will return with our verdict.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.200
The thing rules

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.760
in favor of

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.200
Chieftain Arvid!

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.320
He retains the right

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.800
to keep the map.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.080
Allow me to introduce,

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.120
Chieftain Arvid

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.640
with a gift.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.640
As a token of peace.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.760
-Wow! A knife!
-Yes.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.880
Check it out.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.720
-Look at those details.
-Yes.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.160
Thanks, Varg. I'll say...
It's awesome.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.240
And you know what's funny?

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.200
It has a very special history.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.280
Yeah?
Cool.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.240
-Perhaps you want to hear it?
-Yeah. Sure.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.280
-Who's that?
-He's the leader of the nomads.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.280
It was his knife.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.520
Yes.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.800
It was my knife.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.800
And I stabbed it into your chieftain.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.960
Until it met no more resistance.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.920
And I really, really enjoyed it.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.280
Isn't that fun, Arvid?

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.120
And here you are with the same knife.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.880
He was tough

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.840
when he cut off my ear.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.640
But he cried like a

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.400
baby

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.040
when he met that knife.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.840
No!

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.000
Arvid violated the thing-peace!

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.120
He's an outlaw!

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.040
Run, Arvid!

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.720
Arvid is fair game.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.600
It's everyone's duty to kill him.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.880
Kill the walrus!

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.200
[Varg howls]

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.120
Shh!

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.160
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.440
My name

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.200
is Rufus of Rome.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.480
I am Norheim's new Lawspeaker.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.360
And I have an announcement to make.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.680
Arvid violated the thing-peace

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.800
and is now an outlaw
for the rest of his life!

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.360
So it is up to me

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.600
to appoint the man
next in line to be Norheim's chieftain.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.640
I give you...

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.120
Orm!

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.760
Proud and humble.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.720
Proud and

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.520
humble.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.440
I'm looking forward to
varied and exciting duties.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.720
Let's make Norheim great again!

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.080
To Valhalla!

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.160
If he wasn't crushed against the rocks,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.840
he has guaranteed drowned.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.280
Yeah.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.480
No one could survive that.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.600
But why are you lying on the ground?
You aren't afraid of heights, are you?

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.200
No, I'm not afraid of heights.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.240
But when you're as tall as I am,

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.960
you end up looking extra far down.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.200
So I prefer to lie on my stomach
when I'm looking from high places.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.760
To be honest,
it looks like you're afraid of heights.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.880
Yeah, it really does.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.440
Yeah? Well, things aren't always
what they seem to be.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.600
And in this case, it's the opposite.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.080
It seems like I'm afraid of heights,

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.800
when in fact I love heights.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.400
OK?

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.800
I prefer heights.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.480
I love heights!

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.280
Yes, this is exciting!

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.280
So exciting.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.560
I have many new plans for Norheim.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.800
You have many new plans
for Norheim already?

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.280
When did you make those plans, Orm?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.360
Just now.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.880
Right after Arvid became an outlaw
and I became chieftain.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.320
What's going on here?

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.480
Orm says he's got lots of new plans
for Norheim already.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.920
Did you know about this, Orm?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.720
Yeah.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.640
Did I know in advance

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.400
about the terrible tragedy
that would take place here?

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.040
-Yeah.
-That's impossible!

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.600
It's just a little weird.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.520
And now you have all these new plans.
I'd say it's a little suspicious.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.240
No, I'm just a spontaneous type.
I'm constantly bubbling with ideas.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.720
That's why I came up with
so many new plans in such a short time.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.920
It's pretty strange when two former slaves

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.240
suddenly end up
as chieftain and Lawspeaker.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.080
Stop it! Arvid knew very well
not to violate the thing-peace.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.400
And yet he went ahead and did it anyway.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.160
Embarrassed us all.
And you suspect Orm?

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.920
Shame on you.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.760
Shame on you!

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.840
Rufus.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.680
Orm.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.320
If I find out that you have
anything to do with this,

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.040
your tiny little cocks

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.320
are gonna hang

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.640
around my neck.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.360
Well, that's not gonna happen

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.480
because we
didn't have anything to do with it.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.360
It's

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.280
absurd.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.680
It's just... untrue.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.360
Hurtful.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.520
But there you go.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.120
You don't think we should climb down
and check if his body's there?

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.400
No.
No way.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.880
But isn't that a classic mistake?

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.560
To assume someone's dead
and then they turn out to be alive?

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.520
And they come back
to take revenge and all that?

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.400
Yeah, that's a classic mistake.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.360
But there's no doubt that he's dead,
so we'll skip it.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.880
OK.
Whatever.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.600
Climb down there?
We haven't got safety equipment.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.240
I think Jarl Varg
would get very disappointed

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.040
if he heard
that we gambled with our lives like that.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.840
So the answer to that

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.880
is no.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.760
OK...

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.280
Orm!

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.600
Jarl Varg.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.960
Out and about.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.640
We are leaving now.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.640
I just want to say I look forward
to working closely with you.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.560
You're gonna work closely?

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.280
Silence!

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.320
You hand robber.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.000
What?

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.680
He probably says that to everyone.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.320
It's perfectly normal
for members of the social elite

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.200
to work together on major issues.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.400
-So that's probably what he means.
-Really?

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.560
My condolences regarding
that pregnant pig of yours.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.920
Apparently he was crushed
against some rocks.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.640
-What?!
-Yes.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.280
I hear he threw himself off of a cliff.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.680
Hoping he would bounce up again.
But...

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.880
I guess that's not the way
blubber works.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.600
May he rest in shit.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.000
Hold your horses.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.600
Hold your horses...

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.200
It would be a shame

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.560
if two became outlaws here today.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.960
Auf wiedersehen.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.960
Yeah...

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.640
What's happened?

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.280
Where's Arvid?

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.920
Ta-da!

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.520
Ta-da?
What does that mean?

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.800
It's sort of an oral fanfare
to introduce the new chieftain.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.880
-Who is...?
-That is me.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.000
Arvid managed the feat
of attacking someone at the thing.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.920
So he became an outlaw, unfortunately.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.640
-Huh?
-Yes, and then he was killed.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.400
By Varg's men.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.160
So heaven has gotten a new star,
in a way.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.840
-Is Arvid dead?
-Yes.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.480
My condolences.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.240
By Loki!

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.680
By Loki...

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.280
My heart is crushed.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.440
Can't even speak,
I'm grieving so badly.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.680
He was the love of my life.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.080
My heart's crushed.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.520
Sure it is.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.000
Yes, I guess that means that
you no longer are living in the longhouse.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.640
Since you're not the chieftain's wife.
Frøya is. Isn't that how the rule works?

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.040
But I'm in the middle of
a grieving process here.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.800
-Are you?
-Mhm.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.160
Frøya, now we have to be strong together.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.120
Come, Frøya.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.640
Real mature, Frøya!

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.680
Real mature behavior.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.200
My lovely wife!
My children!

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.880
Hi. What's going on?
Where's the peasant army?

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.480
-They're in Valhalla.
-Huh?

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.120
Or a similar place where peasants go
when they die in battle.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.600
Die in battle?
Are they all dead?

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.640
-Yup.
-What?

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.520
But...
And that's tragic.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.640
But the good thing is, I survived!

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.760
And that's where we put our focus now.
So...

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.440
OK, when is Arvid going to come here
and ravish me

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.240
and take the kids
and burn the house to the ground?

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.600
That's the thing. That's the work
of genius. It's not gonna happen!

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.920
Because we are the only
surviving peasants for miles around.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.200
They are completely dependent on us.
We drew the winning ticket here.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.960
Apart, of course, from the fact
that everyone we know died.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.280
But, you know...

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.320
-That is amazing, Eigil!
-Yes, it is.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.000
It couldn't be better.
We are invulnerable.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.840
Torstein, my faithful brother-in-arms.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.240
You didn't understand
the domino reference?

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.160
I'm sorry. My head kind of overheated
when you explained it.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.360
It's probably not that hard
once you learn it.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.280
It's very easy, my friend.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.000
You line up the pieces like this.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.240
And when you push the first one,

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.520
the other ones fall.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.360
But you...

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.040
You've got three pieces there.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.640
Haven't we gotten rid of
everyone we need to get rid of?

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.000
You think I like these
better than my old hands?

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.480
No.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.800
When we return to Norheim,

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.400
the third domino shall fall!
