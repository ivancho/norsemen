00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.040
[dramatic music]

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.960
Ow!

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.720
Don't fall asleep, Orm!

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.320
You can blame Orm
for the whipping you're getting now.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.640
Ow!

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.320
Ow!

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.960
Well, well.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.400
We're never stronger
than our weakest link.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.960
Hey, hey!

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.920
Aren't you shackled?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.160
No, I'm here voluntarily.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.680
You get real addicted
to the Wheel of Pain.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.400
I noticed that

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.960
I get really grumpy if I don't get
at least one good session a day.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.480
What kind of torture deal is this?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
It's pointless
to just walk around in circles.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.080
No, we're privileged.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.040
We get to toil
out in Odin's green nature all day.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.720
And it's a great workout.
Look at Orm.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.640
He's already developing some muscles.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.320
Your body responds extremely well
to exercise. It's impressive.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.000
Thanks, I guess.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.560
Well, let's get on with it.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.200
Yes!

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.480
Let's go!

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.480
I have a great feeling about this.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.560
Jarl Varg isn't always that easy to read.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.000
But he did seem positive

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.360
to airing things out a little.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.640
Well?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.440
This was regarding

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.640
something about feedback

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.840
and values and so on?

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.440
Anyone like to

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.880
start?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.880
Sure, I can start.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.680
The issue is that

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.280
many of us were left with
a somewhat queasy feeling

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.000
after what happened in Norheim.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.120
OK?

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.960
You go somewhere to retrieve a map,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.800
and you end up killing
defenseless people.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.240
And there was sodomy
and attempted rape and...

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.480
And you end up wondering if you're
actually on the "good team" anymore.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.920
OK.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.680
Anyone else?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.160
Magnus?

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.880
I think what Håkon is saying

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.400
is that we need to set
some clear terms.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.600
Maybe find an emotionally-rooted objective

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.960
for this whole enterprise.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.680
Good.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.280
Anyone else?

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.800
Vebjørn?

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.680
I can only speak for
the younger soldiers,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.000
but we at least feel a need
for a clear "why."

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.760
Why should we join in on this journey?

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.760
So...

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.400
Let's start by initiating a process

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.880
where we simply attempt
to find some common values.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.400
I'm not claiming to have
all the answers, but...

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.760
That's why I mean sexuality
can't be pigeonholed.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.880
-OK...
-But that's a digression.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.880
Anyway, I just want to be perfectly clear

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.200
that even though I'm a big shot,
I want you to look at me as a regular joe.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.400
Excellent.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.600
I'm determined to carry my weight,
and this is so fun.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.400
Look at me!
I'm an ax-man!

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.880
Orm, take it easy.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.840
I didn't think manual labor would be
so much fun, but this is wonderful!

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.560
And the best part is that I'm developing
such an incredibly sexual physique.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.160
Huh?

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.320
I'm very easily trained.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.360
So most likely I'll have developed
an incredibly attractive physique

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.360
within just a couple of weeks.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.280
I kind of doubt that.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.800
No, you just wait and see.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.400
Wait and see...

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.640
Give me the sticks.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.520
Thank you, thank you.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.200
I really like the energy

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.640
we had in the room here now.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.480
And a lot of great suggestions came in.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.080
So, in conclusion,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.440
our new values are:

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.720
Curious.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.240
Generous.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.560
And...

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.120
Playful.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.000
That's really good, isn't it?

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.320
I think now the challenge will be
how to implement them.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.280
The thing is, if they get too complicated,
none of the values will get used.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.800
Can we assume
that upper management is behind this?

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.880
-Yes.
-They don't think it's too radical?

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.240
No.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.240
Wow.
Excellent.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.320
I feel ten pounds lighter now.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.400
I must admit I was a little bit nervous.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.560
Because processes like this
can be a little painful.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.880
For both employees and management.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.040
But kudos to you, Jarl Varg.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.280
For listening and...

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.960
Fantastic!

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.480
Fascinating!

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.640
Any other suggestions

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.680
regarding management's

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.600
leadership and style?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.440
I mean, for you young folks.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.760
Do you need any clearer

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.640
"why"?

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.160
No?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.560
I should have gelded every one of you.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.400
Ripped off your testicles

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.200
in one violent motion!

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.280
I don't think I caught everyone's name.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.760
Why don't we make the rounds?
Share our names.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.240
How old we are, hobbies, things like that.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.160
Give us a break, please!

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.080
-Wouldn't that be nice?
-No, not really.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.440
Sure it would. Come on, everyone!
Why so down in the mouth?

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.160
Come on.
Let's just sit down.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.480
No, if the Vikings see that we're
sitting down, they'll just whip us again.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.440
Nine out of ten worries are unfounded.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.440
Come on, relax a little.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.600
I mean...

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.360
We could just do it.
Come on.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.880
You're actually the first one
I ever brought down here.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.640
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.480
It's so beautiful here.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.720
Yeah.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.560
There's a special quiet here.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.000
Yeah...

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.520
This is where I come
to think the big thoughts.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.000
Yeah?

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.040
Like what's beyond the stars,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.880
and things like that?

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.840
No.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.520
More like...

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.160
Mountains.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.360
Big rocks.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.080
I think about whales, sometimes.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.880
And it could be

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.200
logs, or moose.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.240
Different things, really.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.600
It doesn't matter what it is,
as long as it's big.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.960
Oh...

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.080
Maybe you'd like to start, Rufus?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.280
Your story is truly exciting.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.320
Seriously?

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.840
I'm not going to sit here and share
my fantastic life story with subhumans.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.720
We're all subhuman here, Rufus.
Every last one of us.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.960
Not happening.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.920
OK, then I'll just start.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.720
My name is Orm.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.720
Rightful heir to the throne.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.320
I love art and culture.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.440
But most of all, I love people.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.440
I'm a truly gregarious being.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.560
Spent a lot of time alone growing up.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.960
Never really enjoyed that very much.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.680
I'm at my happiest
when I'm in a tight group

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.880
that does everything together,
day in and day out.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.920
Until that group just melts
into one single organism.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.160
With a lot of inside jargon

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.720
and jokes that no one
outside the group understands.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.680
So that's...

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.840
That's my dream.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.000
How nice!

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.040
You were sitting?

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.760
No, no.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.480
It was Orm that insisted
we should organize a...

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.640
What did you call it?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.880
-"Get to know..."
-"Get to know each other" session.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.360
Listen, he's new to this.
He didn't know any better.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.640
So I can take one for the team here.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.160
No one is taking anything for the team.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.520
Everyone gets to taste the whip.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.760
-Except for you, Orm.
-Hm?

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.200
You weren't sitting.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.160
-No...
-Should we go?

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.040
Yeah, yeah.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.840
OK.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.640
[whipping and cries of pain]

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.360
I'm really glad
you wanted to join me here.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.040
Because there is something
I want to ask you.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.000
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.440
Shall we tie the knot?

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.200
Tie the knot?

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.960
Get engaged.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.440
Is that a ring?

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.800
Yeah.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.440
I had to make one out of foreskin.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.280
I hope that's OK.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.280
Don't you want to?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.520
I totally understand
if you don't want to.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.720
Of course I want to, Arvid.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.320
Yeah?

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.480
-Really?
-Yes.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.080
So then we're... engaged?

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.400
-Yeah.
-Oh my gods!

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.840
Hello, my dear.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.960
-How was your day?
-Liv...

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.040
So you're back?

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.880
What is the Lawspeaker doing here?

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.120
Hi, by the way.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.040
Hi, Arvid.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:38.360
The thing is, the Lawspeaker is here
because we've been going over my rights.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.240
And it was very interesting.
A lot of it was new to me.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.520
OK?

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.080
You see, Arvid.
It looks like you've thrown out your wife

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.640
without a valid reason.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.920
What?!

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.880
She encouraged Jarl Varg
to make her pregnant!

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.760
That must be a valid reason.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.200
Encouraged?

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.680
I was assaulted!

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.840
And you didn't lift one finger
to help me, Arvid.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.200
You don't have
a very strong case here, Arvid.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.160
But let's sit down
and go through all the facts.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.640
OK.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.680
I know I have a strong case...

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.040
Liv, you say you had
a happy life with Olvar,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.080
the richest farmer in Norheim?

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.640
Yes.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.280
We had a relationship based on
mutual respect and understanding.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.640
We cultivated each other
and our meaningful conversations.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.080
Yeah, right!

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.760
And Arvid, you chopped

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.920
Liv's husband in half.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.400
So you could get both her and her farm.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.400
Yes, but that was all done
by the book.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.800
And you punched Liv's best friend
in the face,

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.840
so her nose was disfigured
and she lost a tooth?

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.920
Yes, but she deserved it.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.200
And...

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.360
While your best friend
was lying on his deathbed,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.920
you squirted

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.600
penis milk into his wife.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.000
So now Hildur is pregnant
with your child.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.080
And you betrayed Liv with Frøya.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.200
An affair based on pure,
carnal sexual attraction, they say.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.480
No!

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.120
There are feelings, too.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.480
Yuck!

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.960
I must say, I'm terribly disappointed.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.360
You've gone far, far over your limit here,
Arvid. I'm so disappointed.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.560
This is so not honorable.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.200
You owe Liv

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.440
an enormous apology.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.440
Loki!

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.560
So...

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.320
Sorry I got everyone whipped.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.840
It's kind of a fun thing, in a way.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.920
That we all can look back at
and laugh at.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.440
Like a mutual story
that binds us all closer together.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.440
Yeah, right.
Or...

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.080
OK...

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.480
I don't know about you, but my throat
is just screaming for some tepid mead.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.720
Or two.
So what do you say, guys?

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.800
And girl?

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.800
I don't know.
Are you...?

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.600
I have to

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.280
head straight back home, I think, so...

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.160
-You also were talking about...
-Yes.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.760
Sorry.
No Friday mead for me.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.320
But I highly recommend
ending the workday with a social activity.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.840
There's something about
embracing the fellowship

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.440
once the week is over,
that I have a soft spot for.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.560
We are working

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.120
every day, the whole year round,
so for us the week is never over.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.640
We could just do it some other day.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.960
Tomorrow?

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.800
Yeah, or maybe...

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.200
Some other day.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.920
-The day after tomorrow?
-Maybe we should just play it by ear.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.960
Yeah.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.840
-So it's still possible tomorrow?
-Some other day.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.400
Yes, we'll find a day.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.280
-Do you want to...?
-No, I have to...

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.960
Yeah?
What is it?

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.040
Liv?

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.360
Yeah.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.920
So, you're back?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.800
That's right, Frida.
Or whatever your name is.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.760
Is Arvid there?

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.160
The chieftain
doesn't wish to be disturbed right now.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.160
So I suggest you go keep guard somewhere,
or whatever it is you normally do.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.280
You should lie seriously low
for a while.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.800
Screwing your way to the top like that?
Seriously?

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.800
And that style isn't exactly

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.680
very 791, is it?

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.400
What do you mean?

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.240
It's better that I say it, than you
go around here making an ass of yourself.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.840
Not to be mean,
but you look like a simple trail hooker.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.920
Go ahead!
Do it.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.160
Kill the chieftain's wife
and become an outlaw.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.560
I'll be up there in Valhalla
with a big smile on my face,

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.640
watching you being chased
around here like a lawless dog!

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.640
Who was that?

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.160
Just some skank who had the wrong address.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.360
There are only five houses
in all of Norheim.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.160
-How can she get the wrong address?
-I don't know, Arvid.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.080
All I know is that it was some extremely
slutty woman who had the wrong address.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.400
Come on.
A bit more.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.600
Now, where is he?

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.000
He should have been here by now.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.920
He came highly recommended.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.960
If anyone can steal the map,

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.160
he's the guy.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.120
Even if your title is Master Thief,

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.040
you should be punctual.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.880
I just like to look at my wrist
while I'm waiting.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.600
What is that?

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.680
That chest was delivered
earlier today.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.800
Loki knows what's in it.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.080
That's the greatest trick I've ever seen!

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.040
Chinaman!

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.360
The Map of the West

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.120
will be mine!

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.200
All right, folks.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.920
Big day.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.080
Today we're going to do something

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.280
no chieftain from Norheim
has done in many generations.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.640
We're going to demand taxes.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.640
Or protection money, as we will call it.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.680
Isn't that Jarl Varg's gig?

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.200
Yes, it was.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.240
But it's a privilege that goes to
the most powerful chieftain in the area.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.360
And right now
that happens to be me, so...

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.640
Yeah, yeah.
I'm back.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.520
By Odin, haven't you told people
that your wife is back?

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.040
No.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.040
Or, yes.
Maybe?

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.240
I think I told someone...

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.560
No.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.040
And you

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.880
should keep your cock-hungry fingers
to yourself.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.040
And by cock-hungry, I mean

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.680
you shouldn't touch Arvid

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.480
down there.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.640
On his cock.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.960
I understood what you meant, Liv.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.560
Good!

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.520
As First Lady, I command you all
to keep an extra eye on those fingers.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.760
Those are the foul fingers of Loki.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.840
Constantly searching
for married men's cocks,

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.360
balls and rectums.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.800
Have a nice trip, honey.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.400
Thank you.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.320
I'm sorry.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.480
She suddenly came back.
And the Lawspeaker said

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.320
she has the law on her side.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.200
So there isn't much I can do about it.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.280
You know you have
an extra responsibility, right?

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.960
Yes, I know.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.480
Or, what do you mean?

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.000
You have an extra responsibility.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.880
With your appearance

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.680
and that perfect body...

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.120
Well,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.320
I guess you can say my facial features

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.920
are kind of great.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.360
But I struggle a little
with a curved spine.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.760
That makes me look,
sometimes, kind of chubby.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.800
So I'm not

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.760
completely perfect.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.960
Anyway, it was nice being your fiancée.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.720
Lovely.
Ten lovely hours.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.960
I think we should take a break.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.840
-A break?
-Yeah.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.960
Yeah, I need to think.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.560
Isn't that the same as breaking up,
basically?

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.560
Or how does it work?

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.640
I don't know,
but you're married to someone else.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.400
So I need some time to think.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.160
Yeah, just put it there.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.240
Hi, Hildur.
There you are.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.440
Liv, you're back!

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.000
That's wonderful.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.080
We were so worried about you for a while.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.640
Yeah, right.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.120
Isn't that my cape and my fur?

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.480
Why is it out here?

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.640
-You're moving out.
-No.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.200
Arvid promised that the successor to the
throne and I could live in the longhouse.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.600
Maybe so, but those plans have changed.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.840
Maybe we should just wait until Arvid
comes home. This is kind of up to him.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.680
Hildur.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.080
I'm the chieftain's wife.
You're a subject.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.800
I command you
to forget about this lovely, warm house,

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.840
and move into a tent or a lean-to
or something else instead.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.240
If only you'd been eaten by wolves, Liv!

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.280
Everything was much better here
without you.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.960
With all due respect.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.360
As opposed to you, who have sexed
and necked your way to influence,

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.760
I have worked really hard for it.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.000
And now I'm back.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.480
And this time
I'm not going to screw it up.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.080
-Really?
-Really.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.600
So you can hatch that bastard little child
of yours somewhere far from here.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.800
-What?!
-I'm just saying:

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.480
You can hatch that little bastard egg
of yours somewhere far from here, Hildur.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.800
With all due respect.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.600
Yes.
No, no.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.280
On the inside.
There we go.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.080
All right!

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.680
Greetings, Eigil.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.520
Chieftain Arvid.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.640
Welcome.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.440
To what do I owe this... honor?

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.800
Well, I heard so many great things
about your farm.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.080
So I thought it was about time
to come and have a look for myself.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.760
It's a real nice place
you've got here.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.480
Yeah, well, life is good here.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.920
But I must admit
I had quite a grudge against you.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.480
Ever since
what happened to my twin brother.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.600
Yeah, yeah.
That was unfortunate.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.120
But that's how the rules are.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.280
Yeah... Are you here to challenge me
to a holmgang ?

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.800
No, no.
Not at all.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.280
It was quite traumatic

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.680
to bury Olvar.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.080
It was kind of two bodies, you know.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.640
He was split right down the middle.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.360
That leaves an impression, you know.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.440
I totally understand that, Eigil.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.760
But anyway, we're here to introduce
something called "protection money."

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.160
-OK?
-Which is basically a deal

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.960
where people with power,

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.240
like us,

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.040
protect

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.760
completely powerless people, like you.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.840
Wow!

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.160
What a fantastic concept!

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.280
I mean, I would never expect
anything like that from you, Arvid.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.400
Especially after you cleaved my brother
in two, just to get some pussy.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.120
No, it was about the farm, too.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.400
It was!

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.600
But anyway, this is about something else.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.240
This is about

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.600
you paying us,
so that we won't attack your farm.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.120
I don't understand.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.320
Why would you attack us?

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.280
If you didn't want to pay
the protection money, I guess?

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.960
Something like that?

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.880
But... I don't understand.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.000
Yeah.
That's the concept.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.400
Yeah...

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.560
We'll have a look around
and see if we can find something nice.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.200
I can't believe it.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.840
You kicked Hildur out!

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.360
Yup.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.880
If there's gonna be any chance of getting
this relationship back on track,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.960
we can't have her living in our house.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.240
She's very vulnerable now,
being pregnant and all.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.240
Maybe we should at least allow her
to live here until the baby arrives.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.640
No chance.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.600
That's a recipe for trouble
in a relationship.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.640
Having some free, horny whore
living in your house.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.520
No thanks!
