WEBVTT

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.920
Are you feeling hungry?

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.080
I actually had a little snack
before we started.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.600
So I'm fine for now.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.640
Do you think you'll be hungry again soon?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.560
Or do people think

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880
we should make something
together later, or what?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.240
I'm not really sure what the plan is.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.240
It's just that
if people want to have dinner later,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.160
I guess I'll just grab something now.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.440
Because I feel I need

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.800
a quick bite or something.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.800
And then we can make
something together later.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.520
-Frøya?
-Yep?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.200
What do you think about food?
Are you hungry? Arvid is hungry.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.600
Maybe we can defile first
and then eat later?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.160
I mean, who likes to rape
on a full stomach?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.960
[dramatic music]

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.920
[Rufus] The thing with me, which you
will experience when we get to Rome,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.960
is that I'm the kind of person
who fills a room.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.280
A magnetic personality,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.320
that you can sense has entered
the room long before you see him.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400
Wow.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.600
I haven't noticed much of that yet.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.040
Well, that's how I am.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.680
I just didn't employ it
in that Stone Age village of yours.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.640
People wouldn't have understood anyway.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.360
Norheim.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.560
I wonder if they miss us.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.080
If only they knew
how little I miss them

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.000
and their horrible culture
of brutality.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.080
I can't wait to be among
like-minded people on the Continent.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.000
Speaking of Rome...

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.200
You think we're getting close?

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.920
We've been traveling for months.
Shouldn't we be there soon?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.600
If I had been a globe-maker
or a map-drawer,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.240
I probably would have been able
to answer that question.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.120
But all we can do is follow the sun.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.920
Since the sun always points south,
we just have to trust it, yes?

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.480
By Loki, this is so nice!

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.120
What a perfect day.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.640
You know what?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.600
It's so important to be able to stop

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.080
and just take it all in.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.880
Yeah.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.080
Just be present in the moment.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.080
That's so true.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.160
What a place this is, huh?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.960
Yeah, we were just talking about it.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.240
We should just

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.760
settle here.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.360
Fertile soil. Weak enemies.
Lots of treasures.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.280
That's what we should do.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.360
We should settle down here
and establish a colony, or something.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.040
Look at this!

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.760
The gods must be so pleased with us.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.000
This is the third day in a row
that we find a campsite

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.920
with a fire pit and everything.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.960
See?

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.760
Once you get just a little further south
on the Continent,

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.960
everything improves markedly.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.120
I don't think old Norway sets up campsites
and stuff like that for their people.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.160
Up there in that pile of rocks

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.360
it's all about putting as many sticks
as possible in people's wheels.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.400
Am I the only one who thinks this campsite
looks suspiciously like yesterday's?

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.200
This has to be the same place.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.200
I slept right there.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.880
Liv...

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.120
Stop complicating things.
Please.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.720
I mean,
how different can two campsites be?

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.320
Yes.
A campsite is a campsite.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.480
[ominous music]

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.040
Yes?

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.720
We burned the village to the ground.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.160
Or, what was left of it.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.520
Seems like they've been pillaged
a good number of times already.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.040
Oh, really?

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.400
It actually seems like
they've been pillaged so many times

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.800
that they've stopped rebuilding.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.920
They just sat there when we attacked.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Didn't seem like they cared one way
or the other if they were being pillaged.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.760
This is all the loot we got.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.160
Rats?

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.240
This turnip actually
doesn't taste half bad.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.200
This is so miserable, Torstein!

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.280
Pillaging here in the East

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.720
is so passé.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.920
Yeah, it has become kind of mainstream.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.920
Oh yeah.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.920
It felt like
we just had to steal something,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.560
just to make it seem like
we knew what we were doing.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.320
Bundle up whatever slaves we have.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.960
Tonight we sail

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.280
for Norway!

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.880
I don't know. I'm kind of starting
to doubt this whole endeavor.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.680
-Doubt?
-Yeah.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.080
No, you're going to be famous!

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.960
The chieftain's wife
who decided to abandon a life of fortune

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.080
to bum around with two outlaws.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.320
Yeah.
That commands respect.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.200
The thing is,
I'm not a chieftain's wife anymore.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.320
Sure you are!

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.760
Chieftain's wife is not a title
they can take away from you.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.560
-Arvid kind of did.
-No, no.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.360
As strong as women's rights are now,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.720
in the Viking Age,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.800
I think Arvid can't dump you
like a bad habit.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.000
You know, if I were you,
I'd seek legal help.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.720
Because I think you have
a pretty strong case.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.880
And now you tell me?!

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.920
Yes. But anyway,
that's water under the bridge now.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.920
As I've decided to start saying.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.040
Because now we're almost there.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.280
What was that?

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.600
Is anyone there?

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.320
My intuition tells me
it's nothing to worry about.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.120
No one's there.
We're all alone...

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.560
Sturla Bonecrusher?

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.320
Old buddy!

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.080
You sure gave us a fright.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.640
This must be
the craziest coincidence ever!

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.720
Old acquaintances meeting by chance

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.600
in a completely unlikely place.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.640
But don't just stand there, Sturla.
Sit down.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.240
Take a load off
before I take it off for you.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.920
Have some rodent.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.040
Or two.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.520
Raids are great.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.160
But I'm sure it will be nice
to come home again, too.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.920
I think I prefer to be on a raid.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.840
I guess the situation at home
is a little... messy.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.080
Since we're kind of
boyfriend and girlfriend.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.040
And I live together with Hildur
and she's pregnant and all that.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.280
Yeah.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.880
It's...

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.680
A little messy.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.120
But if that baby in her stomach is mine,
I feel like I kind of have to be there.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.960
What do you mean, if the baby's yours?

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.600
It is, isn't it?

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.120
Loki if I know.
I was thinking about it.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.560
And when I look back,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.280
I don't think she came.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.360
OK?

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.920
I mean, I came by the bucket.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.400
Crazy amounts

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.480
of seed in her.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.000
But I don't think she came.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.000
Or climaxed, or whatever it's called.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.840
And in that case,

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.760
the baby can't be mine.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.040
I don't know if the woman has to cum
in order to make a baby.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.120
Or maybe she does.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.760
That would explain
why I never had a baby with Orm.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.440
So...

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.280
How are you filling your days, Sturla,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.080
after your little mutiny in Norheim?

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.000
I capture outlaws.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.920
And sell them as slaves.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.520
Human trafficking?

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.520
Well, I guess somebody's gotta do it.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.160
We're heading to Rome.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.720
Away from the frigid north.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.840
To more southern climes.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.880
You haven't gotten very far.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.360
Yes, we have.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.600
Norheim is three day's march from here.
So, no.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.640
Three day's march?

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.000
We've spent two months
on a three-day march?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.960
By Odin, you two!

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.000
Us two?

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.640
Excuse me.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.760
If anyone is to blame here,
it almost has to be the sun.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.000
Because that's what we followed.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.760
What are you three actually doing out here

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.760
in the middle of the forest?

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.680
Good question.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.400
I guess you could say
a number of unfortunate circumstances

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.360
led to the result of us becoming...

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.000
Orm!

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.480
Outlaws.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.720
But that needs to remain
our little secret.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.640
So you have no legal protection?

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.120
Everyone can do what they want with you?

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.880
In theory, yes.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.720
But hardly likely in practice.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.440
OK.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.560
Talk to you later, folks.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.520
Don't let anyone steal your dreams.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.520
No.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.960
And...

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.160
Rome isn't a dream.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.840
It's a reality.
Any minute now.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.480
Come on. We have to get away from here
before he comes back.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.040
Liv, you always think the worst of people.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.320
The Bonecrusher may be a little rough
around the edges,

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.440
but deep down there's a heart of gold.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.440
You don't have a heart of gold
if you're called the Bonecrusher.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.560
Liv...

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.600
You do realize that we
have to get away now?

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.640
What we realize, is that we need to sleep.
Because it's been a very long day.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.760
I can get real grumpy tomorrow
if I don't get enough sleep.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.200
And that's not a threat.
It's simply a warning for your own good.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.320
By Thor and Odin,
how hard can it be to keep up the pace?

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.840
Well, several of them are missing a leg.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.840
And this one guy
I think is missing his eyes, also.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.800
This is not good.
It's embarrassing!

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.880
Let's get rid of these slaves
before we meet someone we know.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.760
[Arvid] Well, if it isn't Jarl Varg's men!

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.880
-Long time, no see.
-Likewise.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.520
So you're here too?

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.560
Yeah, we have this incredible bounty
from the West

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.760
that we're going to try to get rid of.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.840
Tell me about it.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.960
Us too, from the East.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.200
Yeah.
Too bad there are limits

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.720
to how much you can actually bring home
from these raids.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.720
We had to dump six slaves
during our crossing.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.440
Because of the weight.
Simply too much boobs and muscles.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.360
You know.
Too much ballast.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.480
By Loki!

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.480
Have you been pillaging in Helheim,
or what?

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.840
No.
They may look a little shabby.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.080
But this is prime merchandise.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.040
You calling him prime merchandise?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.200
Yeah, I am.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.560
You know, the body compensates.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.360
So if you lose an arm,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.080
the body will make your other arm

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.640
twice as strong.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.800
Is that so?

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.400
So it has nothing to say.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.600
Makes no difference

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.680
at all.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.560
OK...

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.440
We're actually very thrilled
that we have defective slaves.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.200
They're going to be in great demand.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.360
Good for you.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.080
Of course,
these slaves have a different appeal.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.600
They're more for the connoisseurs.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.320
Must be.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.880
Not as commercial as yours.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.560
So, yeah...

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.920
Of course, your slaves have
a larger range of buyers.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.160
But if we find the right buyer here...

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.680
We will truly strike it rich.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.400
Right.
Yeah.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.720
We'll see about that.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.280
-See you later.
-Yeah, will do. OK.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.480
Come on.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.160
OK, let's just go.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.320
Come on!

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.240
Get moving!

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.200
[music sequence]

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.680
Jarl Varg.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.680
Arvid.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.480
And the hand thief.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.200
Having a snack, are we?

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.240
And the prostheses?
Are they working all right?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.400
Are you being fed?

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.400
Anything wrong with them?

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.320
No.
They're excellent.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.280
Cutting edge.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.640
Great.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.280
I see you've got a lot of stash there.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.400
Been out west again, Arvid?

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.480
Yeah.
Just got back.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.800
Great trip.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.440
Maybe it's time you gave me that map
Olav promised me?

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.240
I'm going to say no to that.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.680
You're going to break Olav's promise?

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.280
Remember, breaking a promise

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.680
can bring punishment.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.720
Varg.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.680
You're sitting there without hands,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.040
threatening me.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.720
Isn't that a little weird?

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.440
I mean, you're by definition

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.960
functionally disabled.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.560
[Frøya] Yeah.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.400
You can't wage war,
you can't row, you can't sail.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.600
Can you do anything

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.880
hand related at all?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.280
No.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.840
Then what do you need that map for?

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.040
I get a very
"pearls for swine" feeling here.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.760
Anyway, see you later.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.000
Arvid.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.440
You and I will meet again

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.120
under different circumstances.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.320
Yeah, sure.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.680
-What do you have in mind?
-Arvid, I can't start explaining that now.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.520
Mark my words.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.760
We will meet again.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.280
Under different circumstances!

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.960
The next time we meet, it would be
pretty weird if it was right here

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.760
and the circumstances were identical.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.880
Just leave, Arvid.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.680
Just saying.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.080
It would be strange, right?

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.880
So big!

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.480
Yes, once again

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.360
Thor and Odin have shown
that they truly

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.840
appreciate the work we do.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:25.080
Because if it had been so wrong
to ravage and slaughter and rape,

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.960
we wouldn't be standing here today

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.120
with all these wonderful spoils of war.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.120
So on the count of three,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.560
go ahead and help yourselves!

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.920
One, two, three!

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.200
OK...
So you're giving it all away?

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.160
Yeah, it was Hildur's idea.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.800
And you know this stuff.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.600
Yes, a chieftain has to buy loyalty.
That's how it works.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.120
I see.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.760
Now it's finished.
Oh, it's beautiful!

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.360
-You making one in the middle?
-Yeah, a third one.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.840
I must say, Arvid,

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.120
this cape is lovely!

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.280
You two!

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.400
-Well pillaged.
-Thank you.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.920
Have a seat.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.280
You should maybe have something to eat.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.440
You have to eat for two now.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.240
Isn't this great?

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.000
What?

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.640
You'd think this situation
would be a little more awkward.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.200
Not everyone
would be able to handle a boyfriend

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.560
living with a woman
he has just sprayed tons of seed into.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.600
No.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.400
But you do, Frøya.
And I must say, I really respect that.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.960
It's very generous.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.720
You give me room
to be First Lady in the village.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.200
And I give you room
to cultivate your relationship.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.960
Even though I'm pregnant
with Arvid's baby.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.960
You just have to respect that generosity.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.480
So true.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.280
I mean, what the three of us have here

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.040
is so unique.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.840
It is.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.160
Håkon?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.120
Now it's about time
you start to communicate with your family.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.200
All you do is sit and stare, all day long.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.920
You don't play with the children anymore.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.160
And you haven't worked for Jarl Varg
since you came back from Norheim.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.800
Will you please tell me
if something's wrong?

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.400
Children, run out and play.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.880
And I'll talk to your daddy.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.840
By Thor,

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.680
tell me what happened.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.200
Did something unpleasant happen
on that trip?

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.800
You know, that trip turned out to be

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.480
totally...

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.160
Very, very difficult.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.680
How so?

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.720
-Did you have to march with blisters?
-No.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.000
Gnats? Were there so many gnats
you couldn't sleep?

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.440
There weren't that many gnats.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.160
Then what was it?

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.120
We got to Norheim...

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.960
And the first thing we had to do,

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.520
was to maim and murder
a bunch of the people who lived there.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.720
-What?
-Yeah.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.880
And...

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.200
And then Varg insisted
we ravish one of their women.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.840
Ravish?

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.600
As in...

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.960
Rape?
With your willie?

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.760
Not... lick-rape?

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.160
No.
He wanted us to...

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.640
To rape with our willie.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.640
I must say, this is shocking.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.400
-And Varg, of all people?
-Yes.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.960
This time he went too far.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.800
Way too far.
Way too far.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.000
He forced us way outside our comfort zone.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.800
You have to do something.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.280
You can't go on like this.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.240
Work is something
you should look forward to,

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.360
not something you should dread.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.680
You should just tell him.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.960
I mean,
it's all about communication, right?

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.320
What's the worst thing that can happen?

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.120
I don't know.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.280
[ominous music]

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.640
Now tell me, Håkon...

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.480
Have you ever heard of something called

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.680
phantom pain?

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.480
No.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.880
Me neither.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.320
I just had a thought
I wanted to share with you.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.880
A suggestion.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.480
An idea.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.800
Yes?

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.800
The thing is, some of the soldiers feel

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.840
that things have gone far enough.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.640
That things have gone...

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.120
Gotten a little out of hand.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.080
I mean...

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.840
It's OK that we're supposed to be

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.120
a little rough around the edges.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.680
But it's kind of

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.480
the total picture here.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.880
With the gruesome leadership style
and evil plans.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.400
And all that.
Maybe that's gone

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.560
a tad too far?

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.120
Anyway...

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.880
I was thinking.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.760
Maybe we

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.920
could organize a seminar?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.960
Where we can spend some time discussing
where we are, where we want to be.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.080
And things like that.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.200
And even have a value discussion.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.240
Excellent.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.040
Excellent!

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.560
Most people go for young,
beautiful slaves,

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.800
when they want to command someone
to milk their lizard.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.920
OK?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.320
Not me.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.240
Classic mistake.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.920
You have to go for

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.440
experience.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.160
This one has spanked the wank

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.240
since before Fenrir...

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.920
Was shackled.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.160
OK...

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.680
So if there is nothing else...

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.320
No, that was all.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.560
Stop!
Slow down...

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.680
Keep up.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.080
Well,

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.440
if it isn't Sturla Bonecrusher!

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.280
Chieftain Arvid.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.160
I found something out in the woods
that may be in your interest.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.880
All right!

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.480
That will be a little exciting.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.640
Hi, hi.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.360
Hi, Frøya, Arvid, Hildur.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.640
[Orm] Yes, yes.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.120
Liv?
What happened to her?

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.440
Liv?
I don't know.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.040
She may have been taken by wolves.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.600
Wolves and menstruating women, you know.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.280
It's not a good combo.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.280
Well, that's...

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.400
That's tragic.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.760
My deepest condolences to her next of kin.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.120
That's you.
Because you're her husband.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.680
No, I'm not.
It's not me, so... Nah.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.440
So, well...

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.600
What are we supposed to do with you two?

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.360
Well, I was thinking
maybe just forget about everything.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.480
And just start over

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.800
with a clean rune stick.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.600
No way.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.480
Because you back-stabbed
the entire village in the back.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.680
Ain't gonna happen.
No.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.360
[Orm] Yes, no...

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.880
Many unfortunate things

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.840
have been said and done by both sides.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.840
But I think if we feel really deep down,
and sense, then I think

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.240
we all are very regretful
about what has happened. All of us.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.360
No.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.440
And besides, none of those unfortunate
things that happened were our fault.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.440
Because I think
we have to blame the Norns.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.680
You know, the Norns
rule the destiny of gods and men.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.640
Oh yeah?

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.240
Everyone knows that the Norns,

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.920
they twine the threads of fate.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.840
So every man's life is predetermined.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.600
It was predetermined
that we all did exactly what we all did.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.000
Orm actually has a point here.
It's true that...

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.120
-Ragnar!
-What? This is fate, isn't it?

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.080
Sorry, I just had no control.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.120
It's predetermined, right?

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.480
[laughter]

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.120
I'm not so strong with

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.720
laws and rules and stuff like that.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.520
Especially when
you bring the Norns into all of this.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.040
So...

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.760
-Lawspeaker, what do you think about this?
-Well...

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.080
Not everybody will like
what I have to say.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.120
But I am the Lawspeaker.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.680
And my judgment must be respected.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:20.800
There's no doubt that Orm has
the hereditary right to the throne.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.080
That's right.
That's so true, so true.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.080
His father was a chieftain.
His brother was a chieftain.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.400
He has chieftain blood in his veins.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.080
Therefore Orm should be
the chieftain of Norheim.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.360
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.520
I'm very proud and very humble.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.040
And I look forward to digging into
my tasks as soon as I can...

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.520
But he has failed his people.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.680
And has thereby disqualified himself.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.600
-No!
-Yes.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.000
I must therefore put the law
of inheritance and succession aside,

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.600
and say that as long as I live

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.840
Orm will be placed at the bottom
of society as a slave!

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.320
No, no...
No!

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.480
And Rufus:

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.520
You came as a slave,
and you will stay one!

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.040
No, no!

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.720
I can do the work
of a hundred men intellectually.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.320
But zero physically!

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.920
I'm a creative person!

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.440
I'm even left-handed!

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.840
[Rufus] No!

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.480
No!
