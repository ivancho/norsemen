00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.160
As you probably know, Arvid has
and his gang of pests and lizards -

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.480
- robbed me of my hands.

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.560
And Jarl Varg looks like that
a challenge and not a problem.

4
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.000
Or as two challenges, then.

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.080
And this blacksmith has made
new dentures for me. These.

6
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.200
Delete crafts.
Does not meet goals at all.

7
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.760
I want dentures
which is better than hands.

8
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.320
I want dentures that give me benefits both in daily life and in conflict.

9
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.320
I've really tried my best,

10
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.240
- but we're writing year 791, and that's it
  far we have come in the metal business.

11
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.560
You are Norway's best blacksmith.

12
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.640
The one who manages to make
the best dentures will be rich.

13
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.160
Incredibly rich.
The rest should suffer this fate:

14
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.280
No, no, grace!
No, please! Grace!

15
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.440
Don't do this! I have family.
I have children. Show grace!

16
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.240
No!

17
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.520
All right ... It shouldn't happen,
but it has happened.

18
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.640
Now I will learn from this.
I'll go through my routines.

19
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.800
I should have had some birch necks
or some dry grass or something.

20
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.360
It was a bit silly, then.
Poor taiming.

21
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.640
I got it when I tried
earlier today, you saw it.

22
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.120
I think the twigs have become raw.

23
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.360
Now? No, nothing comes ...
No, it won't.

24
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.840
It's just a lament.

25
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.960
Join me on a journey!
Close your eyes -

26
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.960
- and see for yourself that it is burning
  just the rascal here!

27
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.960
The flames lick up the body
to the miserable blacksmith.

28
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.320
Help Resolved
he throws his head back and forth -

29
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.800
- and screams in pain and fear.

30
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.520
The devouring screams of pain are silent.

31
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.600
When the flames dance is done, stand
just a mute, charred statue again.

32
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.320
Now you can open your eyes.

33
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.640
Do you see that?

34
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.600
The images you create in your head,
are often the strongest.

35
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.560
These mental pictures
motivates you to work harder -

36
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.280
- so I can get some
  proper dentures. For work!

37
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.960
Cause of death?

38
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.120
I think - the boulder.

39
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.880
And the subject
I'll tip is the map.

40
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.880
-Must be.
-Yes maybe.

41
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.800
It's not so much else
they could have been looking for.

42
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.080
-They?
- Impossible to say if he or she is.

43
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.600
 So that's a more correct term to say
"over" so as not to step on any toes.

44
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.840
I wonder who's behind it.
Unless they wanted the map themselves.

45
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.560
Jarl Varg. He always has
been sucked on that map.

46
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.040
But he said we were fine.

47
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.880
-Hi.
-Hi.

48
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.640
It was cool that the fella worked.

49
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.680
Should not be easy
to steal maps here in the yard.

50
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.720
No.

51
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.120
I think the break stuff is shit.
Can't we make a dash?

52
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.280
It does not matter
if Life is back.

53
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.560
I've had real shit.
Haven't slept either.

54
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.560
-Not since that - the break.
-Neither do I.

55
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.360
-Haven't you?
- Or yes, but it doesn't feel that way.

56
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.960
But I haven't eaten since.
Just yesterday. Then I was so hungry.

57
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.160
You ... Can't we just
say it's us two?

58
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.120
You and I ...

59
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.120
But we still can
raped for looting?

60
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.600
Of course.

61
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.080
Is sailor a foreign word
for you guys?

62
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.960
Sorry, but the master thief like
should get hold of the map, was killed.

63
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.480
Crushed like an insect.

64
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.440
-So the plan failed?
- You can safely say that.

65
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.400
Diaphragmatic.
Temple.

66
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.560
Yes, it was better.
Nice to ease the pressure.

67
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.080
Would you like some porridge,
by the way?

68
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.640
-No.
-I love porridge!

69
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.560
-Arvid!
-What do you think you're doing?

70
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.920
-Arvid, is this what you want?
-I do not know ...

71
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:22.560
Is it really that? That your own
son to grow up in a tent?

72
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.320
Thrown out of his own father
because he didn't have enough testicles -

73
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.120
- to stand up
  against his wicked witch?

74
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.440
-No, now you have to be a little careful.
-Arvid.

75
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.640
You must choose:
To continue life with a son -

76
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.080
- who wants nothing else
  than your love -

77
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.520
- or if you want to throw him out
  lonely and abandoned -

78
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:57.640
- forever without hope,
  without future.

79
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.560
This is your decision, Arvid.
The most important thing you are going to take.

80
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.720
But we sort of decided, then.

81
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.360
Liv believes that ...
Or I mean ...

82
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.680
Or both
as a team thinks so.

83
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.680
-It was a lot of hormones.
-Loke, ass.

84
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
What is it? Oh ...

85
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.840
There you are. You almost didn't know
again without the head dripping with urine.

86
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.680
-It's mature, Hildur.
-Tiss-poop-fart-joke.

87
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.640
-That's a real low goal.
- Humor is subjective.

88
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.800
It's not humor with meaning.
It kicks down.

89
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.520
To your information
then I feel offended.

90
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.600
Anyway, I need a rabbit,
a sack and a bowl.

91
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.600
Yes, and I need acceptable
sanitary conditions, challenging lyrics -

92
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.400
- and anything but sub-humans.
  I don't blame others for that.

93
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:48.120
Rufus and Orm, you are slaves. And I
need a rabbit, a sack and a bowl.

94
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.480
If it doesn't whip your wallet,
and I mean that literally.

95
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.040
You are literally!

96
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.320
It is said that the first thing to smoke,
is the fine motor.

97
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.280
Much possible.

98
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.520
Look at me. Can't even handle it
to drown defenseless kittens.

99
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.440
Pathetic.

100
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.240
Anyone can walk around with it
hands. It is the easiest in the world.

101
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.960
Small children have hands.

102
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:38.480
That's when you don't have hands,
that new things arise.

103
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.480
That's when it gets exciting.

104
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.960
-Stop spanking!
-Sorry.

105
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.440
-Was there anything special you wanted?
-Yes.

106
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.560
Arvid is smarter than I thought.

107
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.720
I've been trying to take the map by force.
I've tried cunning.

108
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.320
It's time to play
the last card: treachery.

109
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.480
We're talking about a man inside.

110
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.320
Treason.

111
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.760
Hello!
There you are, yes.

112
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.720
-Hi, Orm.
- I'll take a hug, me.

113
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.120
Yes ...

114
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.400
No socialization today either?

115
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.120
-A pretty tame bunch, Kvark.
-Everyone is totally worn out.

116
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.600
Other ties are made
when meeting in another setting.

117
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.560
-Maybe another day.
-Yes we must.

118
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:38.040
I'm not going to give up sooner
everyone sits around a fire and grills.

119
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.840
It sounds great.
I am looking forward already.

120
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.080
-Yeah, night then, Karkers.
- Night, Orm. Natta, Rufus.

121
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.080
Seriously?
After-work mead without me?

122
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.520
Although I was the driver myself
for just this?

123
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.880
No, this is totally random.
I just woke up and had to pee.

124
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.840
-Yeah, just had to vent the spike.
-I air the beard steak.

125
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.880
Then it became a spontaneous thing.

126
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.560
But that's the spontaneous thing
which will be the most fun.

127
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.120
Because then you have low expectations.

128
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.400
So just sprinkle salt in the wound
to say it was a spontaneous thing.

129
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.480
Sorry.

130
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:16.600
My best friend and workmate
sneaks out in this way.

131
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.480
We are almost blood brothers.

132
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.960
Either you are blood brothers,
or not.

133
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.320
You know what? Do you know why we don't
take you on social activities?

134
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.320
-No, I have no idea.
- I'll tell you.

135
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.560
We must listen to the dull ones
your fables and anecdotes.

136
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.520
-My anecdotes are interesting!
-No, they are not!

137
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:50.680
No one here is interested in hearing about
your dreams. It's boring.

138
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.160
All of you, especially Kark, -

139
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.960
- has hurt me more than anyone
  has hurt any other person.

140
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.960
-I'm sorry.
- After a long and strenuous journey -

141
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:10.920
- then you have reached the top of the wound.
  Climbed highest in the wound tree.

142
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:16.520
You have blown up the wound scale, and I
hope you are incredibly proud of it.

143
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.160
Orm, listen here. Sit down,
participate in the community.

144
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.600
-It's a little rotten leg for you here.
-No no no. It's too late.

145
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.920
To be banned by those who are
at the bottom of the ranking ladder -

146
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:37.640
- the subhuman ...
  No, it is too late.

147
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.000
Too late.

148
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.840
It just got totally wrong, this.

149
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:12.080
Now I hope you are satisfied.
I gave birth in the forest alone.

150
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.880
But before I got hold
the little Prince, -

151
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.120
- then a wolf came
  and nip it with them.

152
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.040
What if it was my son?

153
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.640
Was it a little chubby boy, or?
A corpulent baby?

154
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.520
-Sway back?
-Thanks for the support.

155
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.640
Tipper Tor and Odin are satisfied.

156
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:40.400
-Yes, do you think so?
- Mr. Tor, Arvid. It was irony.

157
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.280
-I've never heard of it.
-It's a new language tool.

158
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:52.920
You're going to end up in disarray too
having taken the life of a chieftain's son.

159
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:58.680
Especially you, Liv.

160
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.920
As the driver
for this baby killing.

161
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.720
No.

162
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.400
Sorry I have
brought you here by force.

163
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:34.240
-What?
-Whatever. Orm ...

164
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.520
-We have a common enemy.
-Kark?

165
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.840
No. Arvid keeps you away
your rightful throne.

166
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.480
And me away
my rightful map.

167
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.200
You mean we
can do something about it?

168
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.400
I don't know ... Arvid has become
so powerful, so it's a little risky.

169
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:05.720
Sometimes you just have to let go
shield and attack with both hands.

170
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.400
Meet here at the next full moon.

171
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.920
We will give you everything you need
so we can win.

172
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:39.440
Excellent.
Excellent.

173
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.440
Right?

174
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:47.360
Absolutely excellent.

175
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.760
But ...

176
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.120
Hello?

177
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.680
I see you guys.
I saw you took the robe!

178
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.560
Yes.

179
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.800
Yes, it was ...

180
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:31.560
I have a big news.
I'll be chief again.

181
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.600
Chief?

182
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.720
And I have big plans for you too.

183
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:42.760
But first you have to join me
and do something cruel.

184
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.280
I'm in - on one condition.

185
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:53.040
That I know at the very first opportunity
may go back to Rome.

186
00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.880
Yes, folks, then we have
only three blacksmiths left.

187
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.680
I hope you can cough up some
better dentures than the bunch here.

188
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:21.040
Nestemann out is a blacksmith
which has come all the way from Vestfold.

189
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.840
I do not know
what has been made before, -

190
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:40.800
- so it's like shooting from the hip.
  But people in Vestfold were impressed.

191
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:47.520
It.
Then you can eat as usual.

192
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:54.320
And this one
works like a regular hand.

193
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.880
Only with slightly stiffer fingers?

194
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.640
-Next.
-You can go first.

195
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.760
-You've been here before, have you?
-Yes.

196
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.200
It didn't go so well, did it?

197
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:35.440
-Hope you have prepared better now.
-Yes, I'm very happy myself.

198
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.120
Yes. Yes ...

199
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.480
I want to show something groundbreaking.

200
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.840
May I present:
dentures in three dimensions.

201
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.080
Next.

202
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.440
The blunt if I have to pray.

203
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:40.200
It is fantastic.
This feels very good.

204
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.200
Good design -
and they hide a secret.

205
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:49.920
secrets,
shadow games and puzzles. Perfect!

206
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.560
There you are, yes.

207
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.880
I've been crying together
a pretty waterproof plan.

208
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.680
Is there something wrong, or?
Do I have anything between my teeth?

209
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.760
Thanks for last. We got
after all, not saying goodbye.

210
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.680
You don't remember, do you?
Seriously?

211
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:33.080
-Just drop the mask game. Drop it.
-What are you talking about?

212
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:39.080
-You came inside me.
- Inside you? I think you mix ...

213
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:45.640
 Do you remember better now, then?
"Yes, come on, come on" ...

214
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.880
No no no ...

215
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.080
No.

216
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:04.880
Torstein. Let me share
some life wisdom with you -

217
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.400
- which turns upside down
  the feelings you are experiencing now.

218
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:16.000
It is not the genitals themselves
you fall in love, but the person.

219
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.520
You do not get emotions
for the fungal body or vulva.

220
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.560
Don't be so hard on yourself.

221
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:31.000
You just have to learn the art
to give them to you. Accept the feelings.

222
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.320
In no time what we did,
accepted in Norway.

223
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.600
-Someone has to go ahead.
- Not us.

224
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:45.160
It fits behind like a sword in a sheath.
It can't be a coincidence.

225
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.080
Wait ... I know exactly
what you are going to say.

226
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:55.320
But the timing is not right.
It can't be the two of us. Not now.

227
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.480
We have a job to do.

228
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:04.640
If you can keep quiet a couple
minutes, then we go through the plan.

229
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.320
Come on ...

230
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.640
(It knocks.)
Yes?

231
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:43.120
-Orm. Can I help you with something?
-You are a skilled warrior.

232
00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:48.920
But you have a weakness. You are
allergic to wasps. Is that right?

233
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.280
That allergy
is my big Achilles heel.

234
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.600
How species
the allergy itself so specifically?

235
00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:04.520
One wasp sting can lead to strong
reactions, at worst death.

236
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.680
-So, yes.
-Why are you interested in it?

237
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.200
No special reason.

238
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:19.320
Are you still determined that I
should be slave for the rest of your life?

239
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.080
Yes, nothing can change that.

240
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:30.400
Then I wonder if
not your journey ends here, i.

241
00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.920
Travel?

242
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.160
No no no!

243
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.160
No! No!

244
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.040
(A bang from inside.)

245
00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.040
Do your thing.

246
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.800
Up with the shield ...

247
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:20.160
Arvid! Something has happened
legislator. He hardly breathes.

248
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.800
-What's up people?
- The legislator is hurt.

249
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:33.080
-Isn't he dead?
-What? No.

250
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.800
-No, so good.
-Yes.

251
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.960
-Didn't you make sure he was dead?
- That was not my mandate.

252
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.680
Come!
