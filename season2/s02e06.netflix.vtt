WEBVTT

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.840
Dear everyone.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.600
I must say it feels fantastic,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.840
and also very natural, to be standing here
as your rightful chieftain.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.440
And I have some exciting news.
We have a new sister village:

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.440
Vargnes!

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.640
So now the cat is out of the bag.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.640
And we have a very powerful ally in,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.240
you said it:

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.040
Jarl Varg!

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.480
Hey!
He ripped off my testicles!

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.520
Yes, well, that sounds like him.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.560
He stabbed my children!

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.480
He's not here to defend himself right now,
but I will take your word for it.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.800
His men burned down my house
and brutally violated me.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.880
Well, in love and war and all that.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.960
You know.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.680
But I think you just have to trust me
when I say that

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.080
Jarl Varg is a really swell guy
once you get to know him.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.040
Swell guy?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.320
He fingered my urethra to pieces!

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.200
Now you're just making things up.
That's not even possible.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280
Yes, it is.
Now, when I relieve myself

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.200
it's like emptying a tiny bucket of water.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.680
No, no.
That's not true.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.880
Fine.
So maybe

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.760
that stuff about my urethra
isn't entirely true.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.640
But he could have done it.
He's that kind of type.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.200
I think we just have to judge Jarl Varg
by the actions that he does from now on.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.040
Let him just start
with a clean rune stick.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.280
Anyway, he's coming here in a few days

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.960
to collect the Map to the West.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.440
So that's good.
That's good news.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.280
And then our new Lawspeaker,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.280
Rufus, has something he wants to say.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.000
As you may have heard, I'm assembling
a crew to set sail for Rome.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.760
Only the best of the best can join me.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.720
Any volunteers?

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.400
OK.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.080
Ragnvald, Falk, you and you.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.320
And... Frodo.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.720
Or whatever your name is.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.120
We set sail right after Varg has
been here, so go ahead and start packing.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.320
Pronto!

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.480
No!

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.760
Arvid!

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.120
Arvid!

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.720
-Sorry!
-Loki!

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.200
I'm so sorry, Frøya!

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.280
That rock was way too big.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.400
I'm just so bad with proportions.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.720
Arvid?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.040
And it looked a lot smaller in my hand.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.440
-Are you all right?
-I thought you were dead.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.840
No, I'm not dead.
I'm alive!

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.720
[Romantic music]

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.120
You know, I've had some time to think.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.520
And do you know who I suspect
had a hand in this?

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.200
Yeah.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.480
Varg.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.880
Obviously.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.000
Too many things point in the direction
that this was planned all along.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.960
Yeah, clear as day.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.240
That's easy to say now.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.000
Easy to say now, and...

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.040
When it happened.
Actually.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.760
But I have a plan.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.080
And that plan is so crazy

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.680
it might just work.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.440
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.800
Hi, Frøya.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.760
Hi.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.040
You look so freshly penetrated.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.360
No, I'm not!

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.320
Not for a few days.
Or...

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.120
Hours.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.480
Are you raping someone to forget?

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.920
Or are you already over Arvid?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.800
Or what's going on?

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.960
Come on, tell me!

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.840
You know, if there's one person
you can trust here in Norheim, it's me.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.320
You know that, right?

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.760
OK.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.560
If I told you that Arvid is alive,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.960
and has a plan so crazy

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.000
it might just work,
what would you say?

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.600
I would ask,
What can I do to help?

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.720
Orm.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.280
I want to teach you something.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.920
Fold your hands.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.320
Like this.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.840
Now you open your hands and look inside.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.680
It's a rectum!

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.000
No, it's a vagina.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.000
Oh...

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.960
That's incredible!

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.080
Consider it a going-away gift
from me to you.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.800
Something that will bring you joy
for the rest of your life.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.600
Welcome.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.680
Welcome to our home.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.200
I'll just take a hug.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.600
I don't think so, Orm.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.560
It's so nice to be able to ride in here

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.240
in peace and harmony, Orm.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.240
It's the least we could do.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.600
And this time
there's no pig lying in wait?

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.600
No ambush planned?

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.360
No, no, no.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.640
No, we're sister villages now.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.040
So there'll be no violence
and no sodomizing.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.320
Neither one, nor the other.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.960
Well, we'll see about that.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.960
Yes, we'll see.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.280
No one knows where the rabbit jumps.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.920
But at least I won't be sodomizing
any of you.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.640
Anyway, I'm here for the map.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.520
And I have some unsettled business
I'd like to attend to.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.720
Yes, that sounds straightforward, Vargus.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.520
Should we just go and...
start with the map?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.200
[sinister music]

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.800
So close to the Promised Map.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.720
Rumor has it
that those who approach the map

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.160
are killed in a trap.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.680
Yes, apparently something happens
when you try to take it.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.040
They made various things, I believe.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.360
Slave!

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.200
Go fetch the map in that chest.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.600
Hurry up!

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.840
Yes.
There you go.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.440
Yes, now open the lid.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.320
And now pull out the map.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.920
Yank it!

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.280
This is the map?

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.240
It looks like something
a child could have drawn.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.360
All you have to do is sail due west?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.200
As long as you avoid that sea serpent?

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.520
Yes.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.880
Yes, I suppose so.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.320
Somebody else did the navigation
when I went on my raid.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.120
I mean...
Every time I go on raids.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.480
So much trouble

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.600
to get my hands on this map.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.680
And all I had to do

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.040
was sail due west.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.080
I suppose that's why it's called
the Map to the West.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.240
Torstein?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.640
Stool.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.920
Table.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.760
Well, that was

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.160
sort of our banquet table.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.680
And I personally

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.880
made that lovely pâté.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.800
But now that's ruined,
so we might as well throw that away.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.000
Orm.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.840
I appreciate the fact
that you betrayed Arvid.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.920
But I have no interest whatsoever

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.280
in your friendship.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.840
Or your pâté.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.440
Have a nice trip.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.840
Ride safe.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.360
Oh, yes...

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.800
Goodbye, Orm.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.200
Just one last thing before we leave.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.160
The last domino.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.440
Domino?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.760
I don't know if I have

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.240
domino, or even what that is.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.680
The last time I was here,
a certain person stole my hands.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.320
In the most cowardly manner.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.680
It only seems fair and proper

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.920
that I get some hands in return.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.040
Hands in return?
How do you picture that happening?

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.840
[Varg snickers]

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.720
Hm?

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.480
Frøya, let me tell you a story

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.560
about a little boy who happened to grow up
here in Norheim many years ago.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.840
This little boy,
he had a small wooden figure.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.000
That he was extremely fond of.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.560
That wooden figure was his best friend.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.720
They were so connected.
They were never apart.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.000
They told each other everything
and shared everything.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.200
And?

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.960
And then, one day

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.920
the boy's father discovered
that wooden figure.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.160
And he said it was unhealthy

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.760
for a little boy to have
an imaginary best friend.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.480
Imaginary!

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.800
Nick the Stick was probably
the most real thing that boy ever knew.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.880
OK.
And then?

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.880
And then the father broke Nick the Stick

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.160
into many, many small, small pieces.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.760
And with that he also broke
quite a big piece of that boy's heart.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.680
And that boy was you?

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.400
No, it's irrelevant who it was.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.680
But the moral of the story is

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.120
that even though you may feel
connected to a thing,

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.680
or some essential body parts,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.320
over time, you will forget
that you ever had them.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.240
I strongly doubt that.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.800
No.
Because time heals all wounds.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.480
That's what the little boy discovered.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.720
If you think that I'm gonna chop off
my hands to give them to Varg,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.600
then you're very wrong.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.560
Can't we just call it
"taking one for the team"?

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.480
No.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.280
Where are my hands?

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.760
You're not gonna get them.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.920
Then I'll have to grab them myself.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.720
Sorry, I don't fight handicapped people.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.480
I don't have a weapon.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.160
Pathetic!

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.920
Anyone else?

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.080
Huh?

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.000
Don't do it, Frøya.
Remember, we're sister villages.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.280
This is for everyone you have sodomized

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.440
and killed in Norheim!

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.440
And for what you did

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.480
to Arvid!

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.080
Never turn your back
on an enemy you've defeated.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.040
I just love these!

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.560
Ehm...

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.360
Yes...

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.120
Even though this was very unfortunate,

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.640
at least we've

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.440
shared an experience for life.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.560
And that's

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.960
perhaps something we can build on?

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.720
And then I hope that Vargnes and Norheim
still can continue

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.560
to be sister villages?

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.360
Of course, Orm.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.560
Of course.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.120
[sad music]

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.400
This must be so rough for you.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.440
Suddenly being a widower,

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.240
with so much responsibility.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.680
The way you're handling this
really inspires respect, Orm.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.840
It does.
It truly does.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.360
It's more than any man
should have to bear.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.280
At least alone.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.360
It takes a special man.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.440
I have so much respect for you.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.280
And all your layers.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.600
And your weeks as a slave certainly
worked wonders for your physique.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.240
Yeah?

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.720
I don't know.
I've got some new muscles.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.040
You've developed
a seriously sexual physique, Orm.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.200
Yes, I have.
I have.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.560
To think that I've been so blind.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.000
Floundered around
searching for Mister Right.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.120
And all this time

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.720
he's been standing right in front of me.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.720
Mister Right?

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.080
-That's up to others to decide.
-You are.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.960
I am.
Am I?

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.040
You're my Mister Right.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.800
All right?

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.720
Hildur?

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.880
Yes?

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.560
What was that?

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.680
What?

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.000
-What did you tell my crew?
-Nothing in particular.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.240
Just keeping an eye on their packing.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.200
Aren't they packing way too much?

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.480
Oh, I don't know. It's easier to pack
too lightly and then regret it.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.280
So I'm just making sure
that doesn't happen.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.440
I see.
Excellent.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.840
So, is the ship about ready?

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.880
Yes. It will be ready the morning after
your going-away party.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.480
So you should be all set for Rome, Rufus.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.640
Good.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.640
Kark.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.240
Did you have a chance to visit the shaman?

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.400
Yeah.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.720
If Arvid's plan works,

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.160
we'll see if we can make you a free man.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.280
A free man?

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.360
We don't have to decide that now.
We can just play it by ear.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.240
But we have to thank you somehow.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.760
Yeah, but my freedom?
That's a bit much.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.680
Maybe a handshake or something.
That's more than enough.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.600
But that can hardly be enough.
There must be something else you want?

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.200
Maybe taste some human food?
That would be special.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.560
But I...

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.800
I'm sure I can manage that.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.920
Seriously?
You can arrange that?

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.280
Maybe.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.640
We'll see.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.080
Great.
That's...

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.720
Thank you!

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.440
That's...

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.440
Dearest everyone.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.960
It's

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.040
with a heavy heart

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.040
that we now say goodbye

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.880
to our own

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.840
bridge over troubled water.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.480
A man who knows the meaning of living.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.440
But most of all,

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.000
a true

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.360
artist.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.040
Rufus!

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.040
Rufus, would you like to say a few words?

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.320
Yes.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.760
I have turned this village

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.200
from a primitive nest

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.840
of retarded warriors,

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.240
into a cultural beacon.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.760
I have single-handedly...

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.800
Single-handedly!

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.440
Ensured
that when the history of the Vikings

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.080
is written,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.040
you won't be remembered

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.360
as skilled warriors.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.600
With iconic ships.
No.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.360
You will be remembered

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.480
for abstract installations
and performance art.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.200
My work here

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.400
is done.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.560
You must manage on your own from now on.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.480
And here it would be natural

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.440
with a resounding applause.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.160
Applause is when
you clap your hands together.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.840
It's not that complicated.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.160
But from now on

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.360
it's gonna be like, you know,
suddenly I'll just drop by

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.160
you guys, for instance.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.760
And you're just gonna say:

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.360
"Come in. Have something to eat.
Would you like to sit down?"

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.200
Someone will pull out an instrument.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.080
And we'll all sing ballads
that we all know.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.800
And someone will recite poems.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.960
And suddenly we'll all be naked,
without anything being planned.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.720
And then we wake up the next day
and no one is regretting anything.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.800
And we're not embarrassed or anything.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.640
No, on the contrary.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.520
We're proud of what we did.
We stand for what happened.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.520
Maybe we've broken some barriers.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.640
Because we've been suppressing
some feelings deep down.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.680
And now we can finally

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.120
own up to them
in a more free-minded...

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.240
Orm, we have a little surprise for you.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.960
-Oh?
-Please come.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.400
OK.
Exciting!

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.960
Enjoy.
I'll be back to...

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.080
A welcome mead for the power elite.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.560
There you go.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.720
Rufus.
And you too, Liv.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.520
Enjoy!

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.440
Come on.
Drink!

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.200
Cheers!

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.400
Hang on.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.400
If there's one thing I've learned,
it's that you shouldn't drink

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.720
if someone is extremely eager
for you to drink.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.400
OK?

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.240
Have you done something to this mead?

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.480
You haven't had any genital fluids
in here, have you?

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.240
Seriously?

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.080
Who would even consider
squeezing out genital fluids

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.080
to pour into someone's mead?

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.360
This is perfectly ordinary mead

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.520
There are no bodily fluids of any kind
in there, I guarantee it.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.120
Then I suggest that Kark tastes it first.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.880
Just to make sure.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.760
Of course.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.040
[burps]

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.520
So?

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.560
Any taste of...
[distorted voice] genital or body?

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.880
No, no.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.320
Not at all.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.640
It's great.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.360
It's a wonderful flavor.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.520
[distorted voice]
The subhuman has spoken.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.640
Zero genital fluid in the mead!

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.680
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.200
For Rufus' trip to Rome
and for the chieftain.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.440
[Hildur snickers]

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.960
Ow!

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.280
Orm!

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.000
Orm?

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.280
Are you there?

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.600
Liv?

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.920
Wake up.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.200
Hey.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.520
What's happening?

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.240
Where is everybody?

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.000
Hello?

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.760
Hello?

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.640
No!

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.800
It was unnecessary
to take the ship as well.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.520
[Rufus cries]

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Finally, you're awake.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.200
Sorry we took you against your will.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.000
But you wouldn't have come willingly,
would you?

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.440
You bet I wouldn't!

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.600
Where do you think you're going?

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.720
The land to the west.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.960
And we need someone to farm the land.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.720
Loki!

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.080
It's gonna be great.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.920
Colonizing.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.320
Ravishing on a much larger scale.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.520
Could one of you go get Frøya?

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.480
She was sleeping earlier,
so I didn't want to wake her up.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.280
Arvid.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.320
Frøya...

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.040
Frøya what?

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.160
Varg.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.560
What?

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.280
He had knives

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.480
hidden in his prostheses.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.560
What do you mean, knives?

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.520
She's sleeping, right?

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.080
Frøya.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.480
Frøya?

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.880
Frøya?

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.880
Frøya.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.720
Frøya...

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.400
Well, at least I'm chieftain.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.880
That's something.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.760
The last time this triumvirate was alone,

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.880
we were outlaws in the forest.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.160
You're chieftain of an abandoned village.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.680
You do realize what we have to do now?

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.920
Yes.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.400
The thing that, you know...

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.760
We have to start building a ship
that can bring me back to Rome!

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.080
That is the most important thing
right now.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.880
Good luck with that.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.000
We have to assemble a crew
and just get started.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.360
You do realize
you can just forget about that now, right?

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.920
At least we have each other.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.640
And I have to say
it was very nice to sex with you

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.560
the other day, Liv.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.840
Imagine that we didn't
find each other until now.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.920
If there's one thing
there's plenty of time for now,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.840
it's just lying here in the longhouse,

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.640
sexing

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.000
and waiting for better days.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.120
Arvid?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Now it's important
not to bury yourself in grief.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.960
The two of us need to be strong
and work our way through this together.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.840
We have to put this behind us quickly

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.320
and get on with our lives.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.840
That's what Frøya would have wanted.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.360
You think?

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.440
Yes.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.880
Arvid, everything happens for a reason.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.640
Now I've lost my husband

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.680
and you've lost your girlfriend.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.080
It's pretty obvious
what the gods want here.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.960
Yeah, they want us to be single forever.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.080
No, Arvid.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.800
It's the gods will
that the two of us should be together.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.360
As chieftain and chieftain's wife.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.680
Are you ready for the three big P's?

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.880
Pale ale.
Party.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.840
And bone-dry pussy!

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.280
[loud cheers]

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.120
Here I hold the key to the West.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.560
This map will make Vargnes

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.480
great again!

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.360
We will crush everyone who stands

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.600
in our way!

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.880
[loud cheers]

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.880
And we will cut them in tiny, tiny pieces!

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.800
[moderate cheers]

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.800
And burn them to death

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.880
inside their houses!

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.120
[hesitant cheers]

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.520
And peel off their skin

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.600
and dry it
and use it as some sort of clothes.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.560
Something like that.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.760
I've got many great ideas,

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.680
believe me!

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.680
Great to be back.
