1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.200
-Come on!
-Ok, down!

2
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.160
-What do you think about food, then?
-I took a snack before we started.

3
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.080
Are you getting hungry again soon, right?
Should we eat together later?

4
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.640
I don't really know
exactly what the plan is.

5
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.280
If people want to eat dinner later,
so I'm going to do something now.

6
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.200
I need something a little bit like that.

7
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.720
Then we can eat something together later.

8
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.880
Frøya! What do you think about food,
really? Are you hungry?

9
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.040
Can't we argue a little first, then?

10
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.240
It's nothing special
to rape a stuffy stomach.

11
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.840
What is with me,
as you will notice in Rome,

12
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.600
- is that I am
  one that takes the whole room.

13
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.480
A magnetic personality,
can you say, -

14
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.080
- which you notice has entered a room
  long before one has seen him.

15
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.120
So much so? I have not
marked some of it so far.

16
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.800
Yes I am.

17
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.600
People just haven't figured it out
in their Stone Age village.

18
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.600
Norheim ...
Wonder if they miss us.

19
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.320
They just wanted to know how small I was
miss their culture of brutality.

20
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.760
I am looking forward to coming
to like-minded people on the continent.

21
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.160
Speaking of Rome, are we approaching?
We have been traveling for months.

22
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.960
So, a globe maker or cartman
might have answered that.

23
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.920
But we just have to move after the sun
which always shows its way south.

24
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.080
We have to trust it.

25
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.320
Fy Loke, this was delicious.
Simply a perfect day.

26
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.760
It's so easy not to stop by
that's good. Just chase on.

27
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.720
There's something to it
to be present in the present.

28
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.640
-What a place this is.
-Yes, we're just talking about it.

29
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.800
Should just knock us down, you know.
Lots of fertile soil, weak enemies.

30
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.680
That's what we should do.
Settled down and made a colony.

31
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.520
Look at this, then.
The gods are happy with us.

32
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.720
The third day in a row we find
a finished camp with a campfire.

33
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.440
There you see. Further down
on the continent everything is getting better.

34
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.600
Norway does not organize campfire sites.

35
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.720
They just stick
sticks in the wheels for most people.

36
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.920
Only I think
that it looks the same as we were yesterday?

37
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.680
It must be the same place.
I slept there.

38
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.560
Now you're making it difficult, Liv.
How different can resting places be?

39
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.200
Yes, resting place is resting place.

40
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.400
-Yeah?
-We've burned the village to the ground.

41
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.080
Or what was left of it, then.

42
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.720
They must have been robbed so many
sometimes they just sat there apathetic.

43
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.280
It certainly didn't matter
from or to be robbed.

44
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.560
-Here's the whole booty.
-Roots?

45
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.760
The turnips here
is actually quite good at taste.

46
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.640
This is so nitristine, Torstein.
Looting is just so passé.

47
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.760
We just have to think of something to steal,
so it seems we know what we're doing.

48
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.360
Bundle together what is of slaves.
Tonight we sail towards Norway.

49
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.280
I don't know ... Begins
to doubt the whole scheme here.

50
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.640
You? You will come
to become legendary.

51
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.120
The chief lady who left
on the coffin with two rivets.

52
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.200
It is in fact respect.

53
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.400
-I'm not the headwoman anymore.
-No one can just take away the title.

54
00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.040
But as strong as women's
rights now stand in the Viking Age, -

55
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.600
- so can't just Arvid
  get rid of you, like a habit.

56
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.520
I wanted legal expertise.
I think you have a very good case.

57
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.360
And you say that now?

58
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.720
There's water under the bridge now, like
I want to say, because we will be there soon.

59
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.640
(It crackles in a twig.)

60
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.600
What was that?

61
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.720
My intuition tells me
that there is nothing to care about ...

62
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.240
Sturla Bone crusher!

63
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.600
-Old companion!
- For a sick coincidence!

64
00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:01.480
Old acquaintances who meet randomly
in a very unlikely place.

65
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:09.320
Sit down - before I do.
Take a small rodent.

66
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.600
It's delicious on a cruise, ass.

67
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:59.080
-But a little nice to come home too?
-I think it's best on a cruise, i.

68
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.920
Yes, maybe it is
a slightly messy situation at home.

69
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.920
That we both are girlfriends,

70
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.880
- and then I live with Hildur
  who is pregnant and ...

71
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.920
Yes, it's a little messy.

72
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.280
If the child is mine,
I have to line up.

73
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:26.360
-If? It is, is it?
-I know, then, Loki. I've thought.

74
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.080
When I think about,
I don't think she came.

75
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.040
I came in buckets and buckets, I did.

76
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.520
I came right away.
Lots.

77
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:45.240
More than usual, in fact.
But I don't think she came.

78
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.280
Or reached the climax, or whatever
called. And then my child is not.

79
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:57.040
But it's not like that, lady
must come for it to become children of it?

80
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:03.400
Or yes - that sounds right
since I never had children with Orm.

81
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:19.360
What are you doing your days with, Sturla?
After the "mutiny" in Norheim?

82
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.440
I catch outlaws
and sell them to slaves.

83
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.680
Human trafficking?
Yes, some have to do it too.

84
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.440
We are on our way to Rome.
Away from the cold north.

85
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.960
-You haven't come very far.
-Yes.

86
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.600
Norheim is three day marches from here.
So no.

87
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.520
Three day marches? Have we used
two months on three day marches?

88
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:55.320
-Lord Odin. You two!
-U.S. two? Excuse me.

89
00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.880
If we are to blame someone, we must blame
on the sun. That's the one we've been following.

90
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.640
-What are you three doing in the woods?
-Yes, that's a good question.

91
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.680
There were a number of unlucky ones
circumstances that led to ...

92
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.720
-Not, Orm.
-... we became nidings.

93
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.920
But that must be our little secret.

94
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:26.400
You have no legal protection?
You can do whatever you want with you?

95
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.840
In practice, it is highly unlikely.

96
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.120
-Okay, we're talking, guys.
- We talk.

97
00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:44.840
-Don't let anyone steal your dreams.
-Roma is not a dream, but a reality.

98
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.400
Come on, we have to go
before he comes back.

99
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:55.400
You always think the worst.
The bone crusher has a heart of gold.

100
00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:01.560
Not if you are called the Leg Crusher!
You see we have to get away from here?

101
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.640
We have to sleep.
It has been a very long day.

102
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.600
I get irritable if I don't get it
enough sleep. That's a warning.

103
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.480
How hard is that
to keep up the pace, then?

104
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.000
Several missing bones,
and he behind is blind.

105
00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:38.480
This is embarrassing. We have to get rid of it
with them before we meet acquaintances.

106
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.760
Come on!

107
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.480
Aren't Jarl Varg's men?

108
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.600
-Thanks for last, I had almost said.
- They're here, too?

109
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.040
We have a sick change from the West
that we should get rid of.

110
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.200
We too.
Only from the East.

111
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.760
It's a shame there are limits
how much to bring.

112
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.720
We had to dump six slaves, we.
They weighed too much.

113
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.920
Too much tits and muscles!
Too much ballast, simply.

114
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.360
Fy Loke,
did you rob Helheim, did you?

115
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:41.040
They may look a little shabby,
but they are fine goods, these here.

116
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:47.120
-He who was fine?
-The body compensates, it.

117
00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:53.480
If you are missing an arm, so be it
the other arm twice as strong.

118
00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:00.200
It does not matter. I am pleased
with having slaves with flaws.

119
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.080
-It can quickly be torn about those there.
-Good for you.

120
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:09.440
Serves with a slightly different appeal.
A little more for fine checkers.

121
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.320
Not as "commercial" as yours.

122
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.880
They have inside
a broader group of buyers -

123
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
- but we hit the right buyer here,
  we may have shot the gold bird, vi.

124
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.200
-Yes, we'll have to wait and see.
- We're talking ...

125
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:33.000
-Good bye.
- Come again - the last piece now.

126
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.720
Up on your leg!
Come on! Good.

127
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.640
-Jarl Varg.
-Arvid. And the hand thief.

128
00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.840
You're having a bite to eat?
The hill does the dentures work?

129
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.600
Is there something wrong with them?

130
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:31.200
No, then. They are absolutely excellent.
Dominating within the field.

131
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.000
See you have a lot of grunts.
Been west?

132
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.520
Yes, just got back from the cruise.
Very eelreit.

133
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:44.000
Maybe it's time to give me the map,
as Olav promised me?

134
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.480
No. Sorry.

135
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.800
You know,
Violation can be punishable.

136
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:59.520
Varg, you sit there without hands and
threatening. Isn't it just a little strange?

137
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.320
After all, you are by definition
handicapped.

138
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:09.400
You can't fight wars,
you cannot calm down, you cannot sail.

139
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:15.920
Tell me, you master at all
a single hand-related thing?

140
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.720
-No.
-What do you do with that map then?

141
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.320
I get one like that
Beads-for-swine-sense.

142
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.640
But we talk.

143
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.880
Arvid!

144
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.360
We two, we meet again.
In other circumstances.

145
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.800
-Oh well. What are you thinking then?
- I can't explain that now.

146
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:49.360
But we two meet again
under other circumstances.

147
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:57.600
Yes, it will be nice to meet again
here under exactly the same circumstances.

148
00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.160
-Just go, Arvid.
-I just say it.

149
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.960
Can't do it anymore.

150
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.160
So once again have
Tor and Odin shown -

151
00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.560
- that they appreciate
  on the work we do.

152
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:08.920
If they think it's wrong
to plunder and slaughter and injure, -

153
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.440
- we would not have stood here today
  with such a big booty.

154
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:20.080
Then we say "on three", that's it
just to supply themselves. One two Three!

155
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:31.400
-So you're giving it all away?
-Yes, that was Hildur's idea.

156
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.440
A chieftain must buy loyalty.
That's how it works.

157
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.760
-Are you in the middle?
- It's going to be awesome.

158
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.480
I have to say that, Arvid.
This cap is absolutely gorgeous.

159
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.560
-Awesome loot.
-Thanks for that.

160
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.480
Sit down.
We need some food, maybe.

161
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.960
-You have to eat for two.
-No thanks.

162
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.880
-Doesn't this feel good?
-What?

163
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.640
It could have been a little more strained.

164
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.680
Not everyone copes
that the girlfriend lives with -

165
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.200
- one he has sprayed lots of seeds into.
  But you do.

166
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.560
-And that is a huge respect.
- It does.

167
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:30.240
I get the room to be a first lady,
and you get to cultivate the relationship.

168
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:36.280
What we three have is so unique.
Right?

169
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.560
Håkon? Now you have to start
to communicate a little with your family.

170
00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.840
You just sit and shine all day,
don't play with the kids -

171
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:32.440
- and haven't been to work since you guys
  came from Norheim. Is there something crazy?

172
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:41.800
Kids, can you go out and play?
Then I'll talk to Dad.

173
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.600
Tell then.
Did something bad happen on that trip?

174
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.160
Well ...
That trip ...

175
00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.360
After all, it just became
very ugly.

176
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.760
How?
Did you have to march with a gnaw?

177
00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.560
-Was it knotty so you couldn't sleep?
-Not a lot of bumps.

178
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.720
No. What was it, then?

179
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
We came to Norheim when,
and the first thing we had to do,

180
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:29.120
- was to mutilate and kill
  many of those who lived there. Yes.

181
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:35.760
So Varg wanted us to
violating one of the ladies.

182
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.800
Desecrate?
Like in the rape of the piss?

183
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:48.040
-Not rape?
-No no.

184
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.320
He wanted us to
raped with the piss.

185
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.280
I have to say it's shocking.
And then Varg of all?

186
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.640
He forced us
far outside the comfort zone.

187
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.840
But one should not
dread to go to work!

188
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:10.000
-No, you shouldn't.
And you should tell him that.

189
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:16.320
After all, it's about communication.
What's the worst that can happen?

190
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:45.480
Håkon, tell me, you've heard of
something called phantom pain?

191
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.360
No.

192
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.920
-Neither do I.
-No.

193
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:06.040
I just have a little thought
that I would like to share with you.

194
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.480
An input.

195
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.760
-Infected.
-Yes?

196
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:21.360
It's kind of like that part of it
the soldiers think things are going a little far.

197
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.320
That things are starting to get
just a little over.

198
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.800
It's okay for us to be
a little rough at the edges, -

199
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.760
- but there is something about the total.

200
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.160
The cruel leadership style
and the evil plans,

201
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:46.280
- which may have gone
  a few knots too far.

202
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.360
The idea was whether we might
should have had a seminar -

203
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:59.240
- where we went through where we are,
  where we are going and such.

204
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.360
Maybe even
a round of our values.

205
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:16.000
Yes?
So good. So good.

206
00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:22.120
Most people choose young, beautiful slaves
when they will command someone to ...

207
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.720
... pull hand trolley.

208
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.600
-Okay?
-Not me. Classic mistake.

209
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.840
I go for experience.

210
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.120
Yes.

211
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:46.200
She has been rolling skin since
before the Fenris wolf was put into links.

212
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.360
Okay.

213
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.800
-Was it anything else?
-No, not really, so ...

214
00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.000
Stop. Calm.

215
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.880
Stop. Calm.

216
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.640
Well, it's not
Sturla bone crusher itself?

217
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.560
I found something in the woods
that I think you're interested in.

218
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.480
No but ...

219
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.120
Hey Hey.

220
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.440
Hi, Frøya, Arvid, Hildur ...

221
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.400
Liv, what happened to her?

222
00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.320
No, don't know ...
Maybe taken by the wolf.

223
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.440
Wolf and menstruation -
bad combo.

224
00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:22.400
In that case, it is deeply tragic, so
my thoughts go to those closest.

225
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:27.960
-That's you; you are her husband.
-Not any more. I am not.

226
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.840
But what should we do to you two?

227
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:39.200
Maybe just strike a line over everything and
start over again with blank runes?

228
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:45.880
No, it's not happening. You have
the whole village failed here, so - no.

229
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.160
It was probably done
some unfortunate things from both sides -

230
00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.560
- but I bet
  that everyone regrets equally.

231
00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:02.680
Besides, it's not our fault. We must
blame the witches, the fate goddesses.

232
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.120
After all, everyone knows it's the witches
that spins the threads of life -

233
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:12.520
- so human life is predetermined.
  That's why we did what we did.

234
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.080
Orm actually has a point here.
It is true ...

235
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:21.200
-Ragnar ...
-What? That's fate, after all.

236
00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.120
It's predetermined, all in all.

237
00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:31.760
That is not my strength with promises
and rules, and at least not nerds -

238
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.520
- so the legislature
  might answer that?

239
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.360
Yes.

240
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:52.680
Not everyone will like what I have to say.
But the legislature's judgment must be respected.

241
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:58.400
There is no doubt that Orm
has the right of inheritance to the throne.

242
00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.320
His father was chief,
his brother was chief.

243
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:09.360
-So Orm has the inheritance to the throne.
-Thank you very, very much.

244
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:15.560
I am very proud and humble
and can't wait to get started ...

245
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.880
But -
he has failed his people.

246
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:26.680
He has disqualified himself.
The right of inheritance must be set aside.

247
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:33.760
As long as I live, Orm should be
at the bottom of society as slaves.

248
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:41.160
Rufus, you came here like a slave.
You should continue to be.

249
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.600
-Out with them!
-No no. Listen to me!

250
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.720
I can do a hundred men's work
intellectually, but not physically!

251
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:54.200
I'm creative! And keivhendt!
I have thin wrists!
