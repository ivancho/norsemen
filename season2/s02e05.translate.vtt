1
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.040
The day has come
to fight a tyrant!

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.880
Life is not worth anything
without our freedom.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.560
Let's show Arvid
that he can take our lives,

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.640
- but he can't take our freedom!

5
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.840
It does not apply to your servants,
for you are subhuman.

6
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.720
And that with freedom and the value of it,
it does not apply to you.

7
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.280
Where was I? Yes.

8
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.120
What we do in this life is echoing
into eternity! Dead over Arvid!

9
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.720
Orm. Orm.

10
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.880
Now it's important to just sit still
in the boat, let the plan unfold.

11
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.160
I'm just so excited.

12
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.200
It is important to be focused.
We are so close that I can smell Rome.

13
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.280
Roma ...
The city that never sleeps.

14
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.920
Hey you. Now they are here every moment.
So you get to lead the attack.

15
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.960
Yes, the commander leads the attack, yes.

16
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.360
Are you thinking of setting a perimeter
and form the front line? What do you think?

17
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.240
The plan?

18
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.760
No, that is, I am a type of leader
attack from a little further back.

19
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.800
Because then I have an overview
and see the big picture, somehow.

20
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.040
I think that's pretty common
that the commander is in the front.

21
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.840
Yes.
But no, not in a peasant army.

22
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.600
In a peasant army, the army commander must
have a slightly more passive role.

23
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.960
You know they can be
looking for you on the thing?

24
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.400
You are fresh in the chief role.
They will test you. Jarl Varg and such.

25
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.960
I've been thinking about it for a while.
Should keep me a little away from Varg.

26
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.680
As I usually say: Keep friends
your near and the enemies a little away.

27
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.080
Frøya! Can't you go behind
with your husband, then?

28
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.280
We discuss the tent distribution.
I said we would lie together.

29
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.000
So you stay here and hide?
Is that the plan?

30
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.520
The plan is that everyone attacks
when I blow this horn.

31
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.000
-That's the plan.
-All but you?

32
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.960
Do you use
just as much energy on the attack -

33
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.880
- as in criticizing army chiefs,
  then this is great.

34
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.720
Arvid and co.
is not going to have a chance.

35
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.200
Go now!
Back to your place.

36
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.760
Make, ass.

37
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.640
Come and teach me
how to lead a peasant revolt.

38
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.640
So, I invented peasant revolts.
I have to teach him, me!

39
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.800
-Man down!
-Fylking!

40
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.840
We are sitting ends here!

41
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.920
Let me in!

42
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.440
Dobbelmur!

43
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.080
Medicine Man!

44
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.560
Have!

45
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.080
-Did we somehow get attacked now, right?
- It seemed very much like that.

46
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.840
-Orm.
- Except ...

47
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.240
Pardon ...
Apologies for everything, Arvid.

48
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.040
See you on the other side.
Forgive me.

49
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.080
Orm ...
Don't just stand there. Help him, then!

50
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.880
Hang in there!
Or hold out, or ...

51
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
There is not much to be saved.

52
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.520
They didn't exactly shoot with sharpness.

53
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.880
So, just not understanding that one
must have pointed arrows. Talent-boggling.

54
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.640
Orm. Wake up, then.

55
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.400
But I was hit.
A track wound. Right in the heart.

56
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.440
It's just that bad behavior, Orm.

57
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.280
I realized it was something.
I knew nothing.

58
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.920
Felt dead for a moment.

59
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.960
There we have Eigil, you know.

60
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.280
So, Eigil,
congratulations on top peasant rebellion.

61
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.600
I told you. To operate
with war is a profession, that.

62
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.360
I'm the first
to admit that you were right.

63
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.320
That war profession
is not for Hvermansen.

64
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.680
-So it will never happen again.
-No.

65
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.760
It should not.

66
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.440
Ragnar. Eagle.

67
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.480
No no no! Hi ...

68
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.920
Stop, stop, stop.
That's the stupidest thing you do.

69
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.920
Because I am the last survivor
the farmer per mile.

70
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.280
You're going to die of hunger. Whose
to give you food? Educate new people?

71
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.400
-You only have me.
-He has a point.

72
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.240
If you look around,
then I'm the most important person here.

73
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.720
(Rufus hugs.)

74
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.280
What?

75
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.680
We are leaving.

76
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:21.080
We are gathered here
to hold county councils!

77
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.320
We are coming in peace!

78
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.040
And we go in peace!

79
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:33.960
Whoever violates the peace of things,
will be declared niding!

80
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.920
Anyone seeking to resolve disputes,
must sign up now!

81
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:46.240
Here and now things are open!

82
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.320
Frøya?

83
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.720
Can't you
kiss me on the arm a little?

84
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.680
It is not going to happen.

85
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:22.040
Then I talked to the thing man,
and Arvid has been sued by Varg.

86
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.840
He will demand that map of you.
But you have a pretty solid case.

87
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.080
Just don't get excited.
If we break the peace of mind, we will struggle.

88
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.000
I'm calm as a cutter in the yard.
Will never be able to excite me.

89
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.200
I have that principle
never to let me flip off the stick.

90
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.760
It is important
that you do not appear weak.

91
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.120
Don't run over.
There is room for temperament.

92
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.120
Yes, temperature is important. Healthy.

93
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.680
Just follow your instincts,
then this goes completely painless.

94
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.280
-Be yourself.
-Everyone else is busy.

95
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.400
Right?

96
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.760
Arvid?
Just one small thing.

97
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.400
Yuck!
What are you doing?

98
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.640
I gave you the Judas kiss.
Judaskysset.

99
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:37.280
That's what Judas Iscariot gave
Jesus of Nazareth as a death sentence.

100
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.880
But it's almost 800 years ago ...

101
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.480
It was goofy. That is not okay.
It is sexual harassment.

102
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.840
Arvid, don't tell him then.
He may suspect.

103
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.840
But he could have believed
it was a regular kiss.

104
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.680
Yes ...

105
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:11.400
The first dispute is between Jarl
Varg and Chief Arvid of Norheim.

106
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:19.960
It concerns a promise given to Jarl
Varg of the late Chief Olav.

107
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.400
Varg.

108
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.840
That's right, their highness.

109
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.720
Chief Olav was sent out
to find the way west.

110
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.960
I was promised that it would be drawn
a map to be handed to me.

111
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.840
-What do you have to say about it, Arvid?
-Yes, that's right.

112
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:53.120
They had a deal.
But then Varg attacked Norheim.

113
00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:00.120
And they ended up raping
then chief Orm.

114
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:05.840
And no chiefs are raped
and requires maps in return.

115
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.960
It will be completely wrong.
At least I think.

116
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.680
-Is this right?
- Protest, their grace.

117
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.560
Maybe it all started
as a chief rapist, -

118
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:23.960
- but the roles were turned that way
  that the chief became the active party.

119
00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:32.240
Oh well? For the chief used tongue
and fingers and counterclock so fiercely -

120
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.480
- that he actually went from being
  the villain to be the infringer.

121
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.640
I wonder ...

122
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:46.480
Has anyone been raped, it must be
the original rapist.

123
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.760
Because I actually ended up
to rape him with ... anus.

124
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:59.280
Then the answer to the question of
the chief of Norheim was raped, -

125
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.040
- is a resounding no.

126
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.760
-It sounds plausible.
-Absolutely.

127
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.720
But Jarl Varg, did you attack Norheim?

128
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.000
That's what we need
to know so far.

129
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.160
So far, that's right.

130
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.400
There were some discrepancies -

131
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.720
- and maybe it was committed
  some horrible, perverse -

132
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.360
- kill.

133
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:35.080
Now we have to confer,
then you will receive our judgment.

134
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.880
The matter is upheld by Chief Arvid.

135
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.160
And the right to keep the map.

136
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:14.400
I would like to get the upper hand
this gift to Arvid -

137
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:20.520
- as a sign that we are well reconciled
  and the case is out of the world.

138
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.360
Chief Arvid.

139
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.480
Wow! Knife.
Check it out, then.

140
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.720
Really elaborate.
Thank you, Varg.

141
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:40.320
What is quite fun is that it
The knife has a special history.

142
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.600
-You might like to hear it?
-Of course.

143
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.320
-Who's that?
-This is the leader of the nomads.

144
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.240
It was his knife.

145
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.360
Yes, that was my knife.
I stuck it in your chieftain -

146
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.760
- not until
  there was more resistance left in the flesh.

147
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:16.000
Isn't that fun, Arvid? To think about
that you are holding that knife now?

148
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:23.320
He was tough when he cut off my ear,
but he cried like a colic baby -

149
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.840
- when he met that knife.

150
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.200
No!

151
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.720
Arvid has ruined the peace of things!

152
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.960
He's a bitch!
It is everyone's duty to kill Arvid!

153
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.720
He is wild!
Slaughter that pig!

154
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.520
Hush!

155
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:28.960
I am Rufus of Rome,
and I'm Norheim's new legislator!

156
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.680
Arvid broke the peace
and is riveting forever.

157
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.960
Then I have to appoint a deputy in the succession order as Norheim's chief.

158
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.800
I give you ...

159
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.840
Orm.

160
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.800
Proud and humble.
Proud and - humble.

161
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.440
I look forward to exciting
and varied work tasks.

162
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.200
Let's make Norheim big again.

163
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.560
To Valhalla!

164
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.800
He is crushed against the stones
or drowning.

165
00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.960
Yes, there is none
who survive such a fall.

166
00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.880
Are you lying on the ground?
Do you have height anxiety?

167
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.040
No, I'm not terrified, no.

168
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:45.800
But when you're as tall as me,
then it becomes extra loud to look down.

169
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.320
-It seems like you have a fright.
- It does.

170
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.720
Things are not always the way they seem.

171
00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.000
It seems like I am terrified,
and then I have not.

172
00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.640
I am actually
pretty happy in heights, i.

173
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:18.480
This is going to be exciting, then.
I have a lot of plans for Norheim.

174
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.280
-You have plans already?
-Yes.

175
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.360
-When did you make those plans, Orm?
-Now.

176
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.160
Right after Arvid became a rider
and I became chief.

177
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.360
-What's happening here?
- Orm has a lot of plans already.

178
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.920
Yes ha.
Did you know anything about this, Orm?

179
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:45.560
If I knew beforehand
anything about that tragedy? Impossible.

180
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:51.520
It just seems a little strange. You have
made plans and ... I stutter a bit.

181
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:58.800
But I'm a very spontaneous type.
I bubble over with ideas.

182
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.840
It's just so strange that two slaves
suddenly is the chief and legislator.

183
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.480
Now you have to stop. Arvid knew
that he should not break the peace of things.

184
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.640
Then he did it anyway.
Embarrassed us all.

185
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:20.680
And now you suspect Orm.
It is completely absurd.

186
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.920
Hear yourself
how stupid does that sound?

187
00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.200
Rufus.
Orm.

188
00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.560
Do you have anything to do with this,

189
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.920
- then they end their tiny pisses
  around my neck.

190
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.320
Oh well.

191
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:52.320
But it's not going to happen, too
we had nothing to do with this.

192
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.400
So ...

193
00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.480
This is absurd.
Simply disappointed.

194
00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:11.880
-Shall we climb down and check?
-No, we shouldn't climb down.

195
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:19.440
Isn't that a classic mistake? Suppose that
Someone's dead, and then he's survived?

196
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.800
Yes, it's a classic mistake.

197
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.240
But now he's probably dead,
so we drop it.

198
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.720
-Same for me.
-Do not have security equipment.

199
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:37.120
I think Jarl Varg will be disappointed
if we gamble with life.

200
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.600
So the answer to that question,
Webbear, be no.

201
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.760
Okay.

202
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.240
Orm!

203
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.600
Jarl Varg.

204
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.520
-Is that the guy?
- We're leaving now.

205
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.240
But I have to say
I am extremely pleased -

206
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:30.080
- to work closely in the future.
  Really.

207
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.920
-Do you have to work closely in the future?
-Quiet!

208
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.280
It's just something he says to everyone.

209
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:48.840
It is common for social peaks
working together on the big issues.

210
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.520
Condolences with it
pregnant piglets di.

211
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.840
It is said that he was crushed
against some rocks.

212
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.000
What?

213
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.360
He threw himself down a cliff.

214
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:16.040
He thought he was going to bounce
again, but this is not how kelp works.

215
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.880
I shed his memory.

216
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.400
Calm. It looks very bad
with two nidings here.

217
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.480
Goodbye.

218
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.200
What is going on?
Where's Arvid?

219
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.320
-Ta-da!
-What does that mean?

220
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:50.120
A kind of verbal fanfare
to introduce the new chief.

221
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.800
-And that is ...?
-That's me!

222
00:25:53.920 --> 00:26:00.200
Arvid managed to attack someone
thing, so he was grumbling unfortunately.

223
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.560
And then he was killed.
By Varg's men.

224
00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.200
So the sky has got another star.

225
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.240
-Is Arvid dead?
-Yes. Kondolasjoner.

226
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:18.040
To get Loke.
Fy Loke, I'm crushed, me.

227
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:27.040
I can hardly say anything.
He was the great love of my life.

228
00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.440
I am heartbroken.

229
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:34.560
-Especially.
-You have to move out of the longhouse.

230
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.400
Frøya is the chieftain.
Aren't the rules like that?

231
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.080
I'm in the middle of a grieving process here.

232
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.040
Come.

233
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.760
It was very grown up done, Frøya!

234
00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.720
-Wake her up, then.
-Live ...

235
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.560
Life.

236
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.480
Greetings, dear wife!
My children.

237
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.440
What's up?
Where's the peasant army?

238
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:19.520
Yes, they are in Valhall. Or there
farmers come when they die in strife.

239
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.240
-Are they dead the whole gang?
-Yes.

240
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:30.360
And it's tragic.
But the positive is that I survived.

241
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.160
And that is where we need to focus.

242
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.640
When Arvid comes and violates me
and burn the farm and such?

243
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.320
It is not going to happen.

244
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:46.480
We are the only surviving farmers.
They are totally dependent on us.

245
00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.000
So we have in many ways
pulled the winning ticket here.

246
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.920
Except that everyone we know,
is dead, but ...

247
00:27:55.040 --> 00:28:00.720
-But it's absolutely fantastic.
-Yes, that's it!

248
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:14.200
Torstein Dog, faithful weapon bearer.
You didn't realize it with dominoes?

249
00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:21.440
Sorry. It sure isn't
so difficult when you first can?

250
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:27.360
We place them one after another.
Push one, then the other falls.

251
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.240
There are three pieces.
Haven't we got rid of everyone?

252
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.680
Do you think I like these better?
than my old hands?

253
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.720
I still carry gnats,
a huge amount of gnawing.

254
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.560
-I think it's called gnawing.
-No, gnaw.

255
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.080
As the thought of revenge gnaws at me.

256
00:28:54.200 --> 00:29:00.480
When we travel to Norheim next time,
the third domino will fall.

257
00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.840
Think it's called gnawing, yes.

258
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.680
It probably does. Yes.
