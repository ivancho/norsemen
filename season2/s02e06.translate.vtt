1
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.120
Yes, dear everyone.

2
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.520
It feels amazing and at the same time
naturally standing in front of you -

3
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.120
- as their rightful chief.

4
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:30.000
And quite a big surprise
is that we've got a new ally in -

5
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.240
- Earl Wolf!

6
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.600
-He ripped off my testicles!
-Yes, it sounds like him.

7
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.600
- He stabbed my kids!
-Yes, I'll take your word for it ...

8
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.920
They burned down the house
and violate me at its worst!

9
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.720
Yes, but in war and love
and everything like that ...

10
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.120
You just have to take my word for it
that Jarl Varg is an incredibly good guy.

11
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.440
Okay guy?
He fingered my urethra!

12
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.640
No, now you find things.
That is impossible.

13
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.400
It's quite possible! When I pretend
the water, I empty a wash bucket!

14
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.880
Anyway, we just have to judge Jarl Varg
based on the things he does hereafter.

15
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.320
He starts with blank runes.

16
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.280
In any case, Jarl Varg is coming
in a few days -

17
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.680
- to get the map to the West.
  That's good news.

18
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.720
So would like Rufus,
our new legislator, say a few words.

19
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.720
Yes, as you have heard,
I'll sail to Rome.

20
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.520
Only the best of the best
allowed to join. Some volunteers?

21
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.240
Ok!
Ragnar, Falk, you and you!

22
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.240
And Frodo, or whatever your name is. We are leaving
when Varg has been here, just pack.

23
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.000
No!
Arvid!

24
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.880
Ouch!

25
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.920
Pardon! Sorry, Frøya!
That rock was too heavy.

26
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.200
I'm so bad
to calculate the aspect ratio.

27
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.440
It looked much smaller.
Are you okay?

28
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.760
- I thought you were dead!
-I am not dead. I'm alive.

29
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.640
I've had some time to think.

30
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.320
Do you know who I suspect
have a finger in the game here?

31
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.760
-Varg.
-Of course.

32
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.320
There is a lot that points in the direction
because it has been planned for a long time.

33
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.040
-Yes, it's clear.
- It's easy to say now, then.

34
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.480
Yes, and easy to say
when it happened, really.

35
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.400
But I have a plan. And it is so
insane that it can actually work.

36
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.680
- Hi, Frøya.
-Hi.

37
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.920
-You look so newly penetrated.
- It's a few days ago. Or hours.

38
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.880
Have you come across Arvid?
What's up?

39
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.840
Frøya, if there is one you can trust
here in Norheim, it's me.

40
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.040
Okay. If I told you that Arvid
lives and has an insane plan -

41
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.920
- what did you say then?

42
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.640
I would ask:
What can I do to help?

43
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.880
Horizontal.

44
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.080
Then you look inside.
Open your hands and look inside.

45
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.560
It's a rectum.

46
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.240
No no no.
It's a cunt.

47
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.600
It is completely incredible.

48
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.000
Welcome.
Welcome to us.

49
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.560
- I'll take a hug, me.
- Don't think so, Orm.

50
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.280
It's nice to ride in here
in peace and tolerance.

51
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.680
We are friendship cities now, so no one
should practice violence or sodomization.

52
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.280
-Yes, we'll look at that.
-Yes, nobody knows where the hare is jumping.

53
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.640
Anyway, I'm here for the map.
And one little thing I want to fix.

54
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.400
It's pretty scrubby that, Vargers.
Should we find the map first, then?

55
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.600
So close to the Promised Map! Rumor
says that whoever approaches the map, -

56
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.000
- gets killed in a trap.

57
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.000
Sure, something happens.
They made a little different stuff.

58
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.880
Trelleborg!

59
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.200
Go get that map, slave.
In the coffin there.

60
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.880
Quietly open the chest lid.

61
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.720
Then you grab the map.

62
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.920
Is this the map? It looks like it
is a crap kid who drew it.

63
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.880
All I need is to sail west
and just avoid this sea worm?

64
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I guess so. There were others who
took care of the navigation as I left.

65
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.320
Or every time I go on a cruise.

66
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.960
So extremely much trouble
to get hold of this map.

67
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:54.120
Everything I needed to do,
was to sail west?

68
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.520
Yes. That's probably why
it's called "the map to the west".

69
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.200
Torstein.
Stool.

70
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.160
Table.

71
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.440
Yes, I did
made that pate there alone.

72
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.320
But it's ruined now.

73
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:36.320
I really appreciate you deceiving
Arvid, but I'm fucking in your pate.

74
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.560
Yeah, good luck, then.
Ri nicely.

75
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.400
One last thing before we leave,
Orm.

76
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.280
The last domino.

77
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.560
Domino chip?
I do not know what that is.

78
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.920
The last time I was here, it was
one who, in the most cowardly manner possible -

79
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.560
- stole my hands.

80
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.480
I think it is very reasonable
that I get my hands back.

81
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.600
How was that going to happen?

82
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.600
Let me tell you a little story
about a little boy who lived here -

83
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:53.320
- many years ago. He had
  a wooden figure he was associated with.

84
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.760
They were best friends.
They were completely inseparable.

85
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.600
Yes, one day discovered
the father of the boy that wooden figure -

86
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:11.800
- and he said it was unhealthy
  to have an imaginary best friend.

87
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.040
Stick-Finn might have been
most real that boy knew about.

88
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.360
And then his father broke the stick in many
parts so it was completely destroyed.

89
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.800
And with it became
a little bit of heart to the boy broken.

90
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.840
-And that boy was you?
-It's subordinate to who it was.

91
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:38.720
The moral is that even if one feels
related to one thing, body parts -

92
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.920
- you will with time and hours
  having forgotten that they were there.

93
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.240
Currently, all wounds heal.
That boy discovered it.

94
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:53.880
If you think I'll let you cut me off
hands, then you read me a little wrong.

95
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.720
-We call it a dawn, then?
-No.

96
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.480
Hands?
- You won't get them.

97
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.400
- Then I'll take them, then.
- I don't fight against handicapped people.

98
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.720
I don't have guns.

99
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.640
Pathetic.

100
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.840
Some more?

101
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.960
Remember, we are friendship cities!

102
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:04.720
I do this for all those you have
violated and killed in Norheim.

103
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.120
And this is it
you did to Arvid.

104
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:20.520
Never turn your back on the enemy you have
defeated, didn't Arvid say it? The pig.

105
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.160
Yes, it's their dentures.

106
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.880
Oh, strong boys.

107
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.040
Yes, though
was very little eel, -

108
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.920
- at least we split
  an experience of a lifetime.

109
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.920
Maybe it's something
we can build on?

110
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.120
I hope Norheim and Vargnes
are still friendship cities?

111
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.240
Sure, Orm.
Of course.

112
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:52.360
Must be tough for you, this.
Be a widower with so much responsibility.

113
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.400
It stands respect
how to deal with it, Orm.

114
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.920
That's more than anyone can bear.

115
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.840
At least alone.
-Yes, it requires her husband.

116
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:12.120
I get so respect for you.
All the teams you have.

117
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.160
The weeks that slave really did
wonders for your physique.

118
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.560
Yes, I have
a good deal of fine muscles.

119
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.920
You have gotten
proper sexual physics.

120
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.920
I think I've been so blind.

121
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.760
Crouched around looking
after the dream man.

122
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.600
And so he has been
right in front of me all the time.

123
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.440
Dreamman and Dreamman ...

124
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.880
-You are.
-I am. Am I?

125
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
You're my dream man.

126
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.040
All right?

127
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.880
-Hildur?
-Yes?

128
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.640
-What was that?
-What?

129
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:22.000
-What did you talk to the crew about?
-I fit the pack.

130
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:28.120
-Don't they pack too much stuff?
- It's easy to pack too easily.

131
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.560
-It is good.
- I'm just trying to help, Rufus.

132
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:39.760
-The ship will be ready soon, then?
-Yes, the morning after the farewell party.

133
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.960
-I'll be fine, Rufus.
-Good.

134
00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.440
Kark.

135
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.760
-Did you visit the shaman?
-Yes.

136
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:11.600
You? If Arvid's plan works,
maybe we can give you the freedom.

137
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:16.600
But it is nothing
we need to decide now?

138
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:22.520
- We have to thank you in a way.
- But freedom? A handshake is good.

139
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.480
But isn't it a little small?
It must be something you could wish for?

140
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.800
Yes, maybe taste the human food.
That would have been something.

141
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:38.360
-But then we'll see if we can fix it.
-Seriously? Can it be done?

142
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.480
-Maybe.
-Gee. So good. Thanks.

143
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.880
Dear everyone.

144
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.320
It is with a heavy heart
we say goodbye to our own -

145
00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.040
- butterfly in winter country.

146
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.960
The life-saver and the lifeblood Rufus.

147
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.840
Rufus, would you say some words?

148
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.160
I've changed this city -

149
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.640
- from being a primitive warrior's bull
  to become a cultural lighthouse.

150
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.400
I made sure to reach the story
whether the Vikings should be written -

151
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:35.360
- then you are not known for
  to be fighters with iconic ships.

152
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:41.880
You should be known for the abstract
installations and performance art.

153
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.960
My work here is done.
Now you have to manage on your own.

154
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.440
Here it would have been natural
with resounding applause, folks.

155
00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:02.960
Just fold your hands together.
No hocus-pocus.

156
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.560
But in the future it will come
to become such that I, for example, -

157
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.080
- spontaneously show up with you.

158
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.680
And you: "So nice,
sit down. Are you hungry?"

159
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:35.120
Some bring out instruments,
we sing as well as anyone can.

160
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.560
And suddenly everyone is naked, without
that it was agreed at all.

161
00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:47.400
Then you care zero and care about who
who is a partner, what gender you have.

162
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:55.440
And you don't wake up the next day
and is embarrassed, no, you are proud.

163
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.560
Then you stand for it.
Has broken some barriers.

164
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.200
Orm? We only have one
surprise. Do you join?

165
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.560
Right? Enjoy yourselves.
We talk ...

166
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:14.400
A small welcome meeting for the power elite.
You're welcome. Just drink.

167
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.720
You too, Liv. Enjoy.

168
00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.720
-Toast.
- Wait, wait. Hold on.

169
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:27.440
One should not drink if someone is so
extremely eager to drink.

170
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.920
-You don't have sex fluid in?
-Seriously?

171
00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.160
Who crosses gender fluid
and have it in the mead?

172
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:43.040
This is quite ordinary mead. No
body fluids of any kind in it.

173
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.680
But then I suggest that Kark
tastes first. To be sure.

174
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.440
Of course.

175
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.760
(Voice changes)
Now? There were some offsets
of body or gender?

176
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.080
No, then. No.
Absolutely great, this.

177
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.000
Lovely on taste.

178
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.960
(Distorted voices)
So good. The subhuman has spoken.
Zero gender in the meeting. Toast.

179
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.560
Cheers to Rufus and Rome,
cheers to the chieftain.

180
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.760
Yes ...

181
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.240
Orm!

182
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.840
Orm.

183
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.760
Are you there?

184
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.640
Life.

185
00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.880
Life, wake up.

186
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.840
Life!

187
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:33.200
What's up?
Where is everybody?

188
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.440
I know then, Loke.

189
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.000
Hello!

190
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.760
No no no no!

191
00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.080
It was stupid that they took the ship then.

192
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.240
Ouch.

193
00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.880
There you are awake too. Sorry for that
that we took you against your will.

194
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
-You hadn't volunteered?
-Votes on a dot, that, Arvid.

195
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.280
- Where are you going?
- The country to the west.

196
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.400
-We need someone who can grow the land.
-Fy, Loke ...

197
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.560
It will be great, that. Colonize.
Shame on a much larger scale.

198
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.280
Can't one of you get Frøya?
She slept so well.

199
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.680
Arvid ...

200
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.360
Frøya ...

201
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.760
-Frøya what then?
-Jarl Varg -

202
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.480
- had knives in the dentures.

203
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.800
Knives?
She just slept.

204
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.240
Frøya?
Frøya?

205
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.480
Frøya!

206
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.080
At least I'm the chief.
There is then something.

207
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.920
Last time we were alone,
were we nidings in a forest.

208
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.600
You're the chief
over an abandoned village!

209
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.280
-You know what we need to do now?
-Yes.

210
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.840
No. Yes, or ...

211
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:41.840
We have to build a ship
that can get me back to Rome!

212
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.280
Good luck.

213
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.040
We have to have a crew, people like that
can build ships and get started!

214
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.280
You see that you just
must let go, Rufus?

215
00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:00.240
But we have each other. And that
was really ok to have sex with you, Liv.

216
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:05.320
It's incredible that we don't have one
found each other before now, but ...

217
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.520
Is there anything we have time for now,
then it is to lie here in the longhouse -

218
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.640
- and sexy and just
  wait for better times.

219
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.200
Arvid?

220
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.080
It is important
not to dig into grief.

221
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:16.040
Now we must be strong
and work our way through this together.

222
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.520
We have to leave it behind us
and move on with life.

223
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.320
-That's what Frøya would have wanted.
- Do you think so?

224
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.040
Everything happens for a reason, Arvid.

225
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.000
I've lost my husband;
you've lost your girlfriend.

226
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.680
- It's clear what the gods want.
- That we should be single forever.

227
00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.920
No, Arvid.
That you and I should be together.

228
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.400
As chieftain and chieftain.

229
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.120
Are you ready
to swim in the three m's?

230
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:28.040
Food, mead and crispy mouse?

231
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.840
Here I hold the key to the West.

232
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:40.960
This map will do Vargnes
to the most powerful city in Norway!

233
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.080
We will crush all resistance
that's coming our way!

234
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.920
We have to cut the enemy
in tiny little pieces!

235
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.000
And we need to burn them
inside your houses!

236
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.440
I'm going to cut off their skin,
dry it and use it -

237
00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.240
- like a kind of suit.

238
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:09.120
Oh, I have so many
good ideas. It just bubbles over.

239
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.840
It is completely incredible.
