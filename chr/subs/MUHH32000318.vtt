1
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.520
Jarl Varg has to die on the most
cruel way for what he did.

2
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.960
It is important that people
keeps a close eye on what we like.

3
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.680
Do not boast that we are gathering an army
who will be steering Jarl Varg.

4
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.240
I can't say where
important is that people hold tight, -

5
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.600
- so Jarl Varg
  do not get the fort of this.

6
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.440
You can trust me. I'm not saying
something against a stingy reward -

7
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.720
- as true as I am
  Know the deceitful.

8
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.040
- That name does not inspire confidence.
-Vidkun?

9
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.680
 No, the other name. Your name is
"the fraudulent" to last name?

10
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.400
OK.

11
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.840
I thought you were a leader like that
judged people by what they do, -

12
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.920
- and not what they are called.
  Maybe I was wrong?

13
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.280
Of course not. But it is
a special name. The deceitful.

14
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.560
Probably I got it because
I am in excess of trust.

15
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.800
I have kept close to so much
that it has become too much of a good thing.

16
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.520
That's why I got
an ironic nickname.

17
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.200
I've never heard of
ironic Viking names before.

18
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.720
OK, so you've definitely heard
all Viking names throughout Norway?

19
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.640
-No.
- Then we wouldn't have had this conversation.

20
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.600
Many have ironic names.
Very many around.

21
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.320
And when it comes to being deceitful
my look, it's the same.

22
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.720
Do not look at the dog on the hair.

23
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.640
Did it look deceptive,
means I'm not.

24
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.720
Of course. You are right.
My mistake. Sorry.

25
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.960
Anyway:No one has to reveal that I am
planning an attack on Jarl Varg.

26
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.000
It has to come
as a surprise. OK?

27
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.640
OK. I will not let you down,
Jarl Bjørn.

28
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.640
I promise that in faith and honor.

29
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.280
It's the groom, after all.

30
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.880
You wanted to talk about something?

31
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.800
There was something on the stag team
which was disturbing.

32
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.040
-Yes, it went a little wild.
- It didn't go wild. But ...

33
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.400
That with intimacy
with opposite sex and such.

34
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.400
-Yes, I know all about it.
-Yes?

35
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.880
- You can never be taught, Orm.
-Yes.

36
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.760
No. Now the wedding night is approaching,
and Frøya is probably no beginner.

37
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.640
I thought we should have
a refresher course in here.

38
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.160
-You want us to go in and ...
-Yes. Now.

39
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.720
Yes, it's a bit unconventional, though
as brothers is it perhaps natural?

40
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:23.760
No, but then just ... You start in
me, then I'll penetrate you afterwards?

41
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.640
-What?
- Or do you sex with me first?

42
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.280
No! What ...
Absolutely not, Orm!

43
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.240
No, that would be very unnatural.

44
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.040
Just because you ...

45
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.640
But then it's forgotten, then.

46
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.480
So, then I'm in place.
Are you fine?

47
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.200
Then the sexual interaction begins
between man and woman.

48
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.560
Now I bring the meat
into the vagina.

49
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.480
-Once?
-No, it is repeated repeatedly.

50
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.720
And then I really enjoy.

51
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.240
And then you find a nice rhythm.

52
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.680
Then you may well have a quad going
inside your head, and then you keep the rhythm.

53
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.960
Stay tuned now.
You're not watching.

54
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.440
The arch you make at the end ...
Then she enjoys the extra.

55
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.280
Watch the woman's face ...
Now she enjoys, you see?

56
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.680
Then you can increase the rhythm.

57
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.520
Like that ...

58
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.160
Here's how you develop
a fountain orgasm, Orm.

59
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.920
But it is extras, that is.

60
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.760
Yes. Next step. Don't aim yourself
into it in the first place.

61
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.480
Now just concentrate
mostly about geography.

62
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.920
Yes, questions?

63
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.640
If I got it right, then ...
That bag of balls, -

64
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.320
- it should just dangle back and forth
  without purpose and meaning? Not in?

65
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.840
-No.
-Not into the other hole either?

66
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.680
-No no.
-For it could just as well have been like that?

67
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.080
It's not impossible, I mean.
It depends on what you are used to.

68
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.640
It's just not
how it works, Orm.

69
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.360
-But it could have been that way.
- That's not how it works.

70
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.200
Maybe not in Norway,
but in other cultures.

71
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.600
I highly doubt that.

72
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.080
Elsewhere, it can be unnatural
to sex without having the bag in the back hole.

73
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.280
And then they discuss the same thing there.
Just the opposite. That's my point.

74
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.400
But otherwise it was very ...
You can't know everything.

75
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:09.280
Just what I fear: a welded bunch
after the stag party.

76
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.800
A little downfall that we didn't get it, then.

77
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.880
Have you heard anything more
about table seating and things like that?

78
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.280
We get to sit together?
We have to.

79
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:32.400
I just stress with the small talk
with strangers.

80
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.280
Everyone is good at it except me.

81
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.280
-Froya, are you there?
-Yes?

82
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.280
You haven't got
cold feet or something?

83
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.800
Why should I do that?

84
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.880
No, no reason.
No reason at all.

85
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:20.920
You must be one of my closest friends
warriors, and then you need some equipment.

86
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
This is the latest
in sword, dagger, ax ...

87
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.800
Not that much has happened
that front for the last thousand years,

88
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.880
- but this is the latest.

89
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.000
I've got a brow,

90
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.360
- but was a little unsure
  on it with ... Yes.

91
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.560
But you just get to see the hill it works.

92
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.680
And I've been stitched
a wedding dress for you.

93
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.880
Since you have a little like that
different clothes then.

94
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.040
-OK.
-You're gonna shine.

95
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.320
Yes.

96
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.880
I only thought of one thing.

97
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.000
Don't go around asking and digging
about how Orm is as a person.

98
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.400
- There's no point.
-Why not?

99
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.080
No why ...

100
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.960
- People are envious. They are talking.
-Yes, people are envious and talk.

101
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.200
-Oh true! Look here, yes.
-Wow.

102
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.840
It never feels strange to have met the bride.

103
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.800
There you have been lucky.
It's going to be great, Orm.

104
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.560
Yes, I should just be myself.

105
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.160
Yes, or I almost think
that you should not be so much yourself.

106
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.280
-Why?
- I'm just saying it to help you.

107
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.000
But you might have
tends to sound a bit much.

108
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.200
People sometimes look
that you can be a little intense.

109
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.120
- Very, very suffocating.
- You're like that.

110
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:40.800
You're clumsy, intense and suffocating.
Like that. Then the cat is out of the bag.

111
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.760
You too, Hildur.
Very clumsy.

112
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.840
Orm, it was just a well-meaning advice.

113
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.440
"Don't be yourself" -
 the worst advice of all time.

114
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.440
Worm ...

115
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.480
And Lord Tor and Odin. It is
power-bonanza in here, yes.

116
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.600
Yes ...

117
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.280
Just one glance at the power elite
and the dune is in tight guard.

118
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.640
Is it available here, or?

119
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.560
Yes.

120
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.680
You just stand on the dress ...

121
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.720
-Yes, it was a wedding, then.
-That it was?

122
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.440
- It was a wedding.
-Yes, like that, yes. That's it.

123
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:39.960
It is actually a bit urgent
with getting rubbed off by one here.

124
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.080
Yes, it is a long time ago.

125
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.640
Maybe it had
been a little exciting.

126
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.320
A bit "illegal" and "daredevil".

127
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.160
Shall we ...

128
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.240
Just sit down, Olvar, this is
something I have to do on my own.

129
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.360
What is their relationship?
to the bridal couple, then?

130
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.560
We know the groom.
But we are from Norheim.

131
00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.400
- Who's from here?
-Yes.

132
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:39.240
Yes.
And enjoy living in Norheim?

133
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:44.400
Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

134
00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:02.200
I did just that
to take a small round before it starts.

135
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.560
It seems ...
It looks nice.

136
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.080
-Yes it does.
-It is ...

137
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.880
-Velholdt.
-Yes ...

138
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.200
Well maintained is the word.
-That's possible.

139
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.800
It is
slightly weathered, but ...

140
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.000
That's why we live here.
The country of special interest.

141
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.680
- The country for ...?
-Particularily interested.

142
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.520
Yes. It is ...
Yes then. There is something in it.

143
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.680
No, then. It have to be
room to sneak a little too.

144
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.480
Yes. Are you kidding now?
I didn't understand.

145
00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:02.160
No, it was joking.
I like to draw a whiff occasionally.

146
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:10.520
Yes. There is so much seriousness and
misery now in the Viking Age, so ...

147
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.760
Right.

148
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.880
Can't help but complain, say.
Isn't that what they say?

149
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:22.080
I don't know, but sure.
Since you say it.

150
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.680
Yes, it is.

151
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.320
- It was joking, too.
-OK.

152
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.600
Can I have some more drinks?

153
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.800
He is perfect.

154
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.240
She's perfect, was what I said.
She is perfect.

155
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.880
That's why I'm so hard on
that vision is the most important sense.

156
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.040
Almost everything is recorded with the sight.

157
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.720
Disappears sense of smell
or sense of taste, -

158
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:42.240
- it's our eyes that protect us
  against dangers. They are indispensable.

159
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.720
Not to break in, but it is
anyone who wants to expose?

160
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.000
Someone who feels cold?
Tina?

161
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.240
-Yes ... What is it about?
-You pop up and get blood.

162
00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:05.400
Then the blood is used to make up
the bride and groom. The corpse goes to the pigs.

163
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.400
It is very honorable,
Just so it is said.

164
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.480
It doesn't sound very honorable
to be cut up as a party trick.

165
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:22.400
No, that doesn't sound very tempting,
but it is much more than that.

166
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:28.160
You become the focal point of the party.
Maybe you find some meaning in it?

167
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.640
I don't know, but ...

168
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.320
I believe God's plan for me
does not involve being sacrificed.

169
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.600
- Can't we vote on that?
-It is fair.

170
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.680
Mega Fair. Then it can
become any of us.

171
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:50.120
So everyone who votes for Vegard
should be exposed, raise his hand.

172
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.120
Here I must say
that I disagree with the majority.

173
00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.360
The individual's intent is the same
heaviness in a collective decision.

174
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:08.280
Yes, something else would be madness. But
it is allowed to be disappointed. Thanks for now.

175
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:15.560
Where was I? You, the sight.
There you see how important the vision is ...

176
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.920
Thanks.

177
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.560
Oh, look here, then.

178
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.480
Thanks.

179
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:45.440
Really exciting, this, then.
Brand new chapter in life and stuff.

180
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:51.320
-Yes. Yes yes.
-You look really strong.

181
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:57.200
Proper muscular arms.
It appeals to me a lot.

182
00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:03.600
Yes? Yes, maybe I always have
been such a boy girl, i.

183
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.080
Yes, I do too.

184
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.160
Me too. Or what did they say?
Such a girl.

185
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.120
Here's a gift from me to you.

186
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.640
With desire
a long and good marriage.

187
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.800
-Thanks. Can we open right away?
-You're welcome.

188
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.480
-Tannebisser?
- From people?

189
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.720
An assorted selection. Here is
from a thicket, here a limp, -

190
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:56.680
- a curl top, a little dwarf,
  a mongoloid and a whore.

191
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.840
Orm?
Don't you think about them?

192
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.360
Yes, it is a very nice gift.

193
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.440
I like it.
I like teeth.

194
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.680
Good.
It was good to hear.

195
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:22.360
It would have been sad if this one
great gift should dust away.

196
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:29.000
No, it's an absolutely amazing gift,
and we both appreciate it.

197
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.600
I am very glad to hear that.

198
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.280
Likewise.

199
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.680
-Is this from Jarl Bjørn?
-Yes. An absolutely amazing gift.

200
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.480
Unfortunately he couldn't be here,
but he is very nice.

201
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.720
- Is he alive?
-Yes.

202
00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:00.000
I think you're starting
getting thin in the string, Wolf?

203
00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:05.080
Hairless whore ...

204
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.160
Thick hair is more important
than thick genitals ...

205
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.640
Nobody loves a bald man ...

206
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.320
I have a formidable one
task ahead of me.

207
00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:08.160
Kinsmen! One thing remains
before the marriage is completed:

208
00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.240
Blotting of slavery!

209
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:39.360
Promise me that marriage lasts,
otherwise it feels pointless.

210
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.840
Yes, marriage lasts a lifetime.

211
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.000
I sacrifice life here.
After all, it should be worth it.

212
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.920
Yes, enough about it and enough about you.

213
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.480
I do not know ...

214
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:47.280
Imagine that, from now on it just is
you and me from morning to night.

215
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.560
- Think about it.
- Every morning and evening I'm there.

216
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.640
-It's wise with some real time as well.
-Or not.

217
00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:02.320
All meals together, holidays,
your friends are my friends ...

218
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.960
Maybe we can
Have hobbies together too?

219
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.720
- Have you pioneered much?
-No.

220
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.520
-Finger crochet, then?
-No.

221
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:17.440
Poetry, is it a common passion?

222
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.520
No.

223
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.200
-Do you make royal figures? Kongledyr?
-No.

224
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.200
-Do you collect pearls?
-No.

225
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.280
-That ordinary shells?
-No.

226
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:36.760
You will love it in a little while.
We become inseparable. Like pea.

227
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.840
We become like twins
that stick together.

228
00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.880
- Has anything happened, right?
- They got married, then.

229
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.280
It was a great,
tearful ceremony. Epic.

230
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.480
-Fine talking and ...
-Sorry, I lost myself out there.

231
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.800
The hours just flew.
I had to drive a "doublare".

232
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.440
Still, I have plenty
sexual tension in the body.

233
00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.520
Yes, but I can
stand in service, i.

234
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:31.680
I'm hungry. Are you sending the bread?
I just need something fast.

235
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.280
Dog.

236
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.600
We sit and talk a little.
Or take a breather ...

237
00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.640
-We are leaving.
- Is it okay?

238
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.560
Never had it better.

239
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.600
I have big revenge plans
that grinds in me.

240
00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.680
Come.

241
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.440
Look here.

242
00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:31.000
-All right, Wolf?
-I take ten percent of the gifts.

243
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.320
- You bring gifts?
-Skatter.

244
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.280
This is standard procedure.

245
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.600
And Odin knows we need to
all the treasures we can get.

246
00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:49.160
Jaha.
Is there something special going on?

247
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.240
There are dark clouds on the horizon, Olav.

248
00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.760
It brews up to war!

249
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.360
Isn't it war all the time, really?

250
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.400
Yes, but it is
a little more war than before, Olav.

251
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:15.000
It brews up to
a little more war than before.

252
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.400
Lets see ...
There we were ... No, wait.

253
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:32.360
It should be like that
totally impossible to find your own piss, now?

254
00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.800
There it was, the trick.
Let's see ...

255
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.120
- Am I inside you now?
-No.

256
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.120
There I will be in place.

257
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.000
Fantastic.
What a feeling.

258
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.440
- Still not inside, that is.
-What?

259
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:58.480
Then I have to double check you.

260
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.200
-Other way ...
-Oh yes. There, yes.

261
00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.160
There you go.
There you go!

262
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.680
There was something else, yes ...
