00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:13.040
I can't stress enough the importance
of having a beautiful head with hair.

2
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.080
Totally agree.

3
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.280
The hair is my pride and my adornment.
What would I have been without?

4
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.120
- It's not good to say that.
-One thing I learned:

5
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.800
The hair of a man
says everything about his personality.

6
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.520
A bald man
is like a blank rune stick.

7
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.320
Zero personality.
Zero content.

8
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
And we who have thick, strong hair,

9
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.040
- has several choices
  in terms of appearance.

10
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.000
No, you are not tied to one weld
as when one is bald.

11
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.160
Hey Hey.

12
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.680
My dearest wife.
So you are - so beautiful.

13
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.800
-Thank you darling.
- I couldn't get a better wife.

14
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.560
I couldn't have gotten a better man.
But we almost have to leave now.

15
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.320
A guest of honor does not come
too late for Jarl Bjorn's guild.

16
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.040
- Am I fine on my hair?
-Great. Well combed, Dog.

17
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.320
Make the combs clear
until i come back?

18
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.080
Then we can experiment with new ones
welds and hairstyles and ... Look forward to it.

19
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.080
Have a good time.

20
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.680
Varg! Finally you are here.
My very best friend.

21
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.000
Reidun.
More beautiful than ever.

22
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.360
Bjorn, there is no man
I set higher.

23
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.840
Likewise. Likewise.

24
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.840
We are soul mates who have known
each other since we were baby babies.

25
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.560
We share a worldview, humor
and talk to each other in confidence.

26
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.280
We respect
each other's peculiarities.

27
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.320
And we dare
to be vulnerable in front of each other.

28
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.360
We do, Varg.

29
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.600
And you have been an invaluable supporter
when life has not been easy.

30
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.320
Had everyone had such a best friend,
the world would have been a better place.

31
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.000
Toast!

32
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.920
Seems you're starting
getting thin in the string, eh?

33
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.960
-That it was?
-Nothing.

34
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.400
Just that you
is starting to get a little thin in the string.

35
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.560
-Yeah right?
- No, don't say that, then.

36
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.080
-The hair loss is his great pride.
-Thanks and crap.

37
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.040
congratulations with
Midgard's sloping mane.

38
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.920
Midgard's shrinking mane?
Absolutely. Good humor, that.

39
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.760
No. Sorry, my wolf,
do not worry about it.

40
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.880
You look just fine with thin hair.
Maybe even nicer, actually.

41
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.560
-You actually do hair loss.
-Absolutely.

42
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.800
It wasn't meant to be fun.
Hair loss can be mentally stressful.

43
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.520
-I hope you can forgive me?
-You are forgiven. No problem.

44
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.600
I'm not the type to carry gnats.

45
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.960
Then we sit down to dinner!

46
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.880
(Shout in the distance.)

47
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.160
Up there!

48
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.600
Stop!

49
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.760
Stop!
Run!

50
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.280
Up! Up!

51
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.200
Shut up!
Don't scream!

52
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.280
Seems you're starting
getting thin in the string ...

53
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.720
You actually do hair loss ...

54
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.280
Congratulations to Midgards
craziest mane ...

55
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.960
-You're not mad at those things?
-No no.

56
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.840
There should be some headroom
among us good friends.

57
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.520
I had a bad conscience
because I laughed.

58
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.080
Dear you, laughter is
a spontaneous emotional outburst.

59
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.680
It is something
one has no control over.

60
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.360
-OK. Excuse me anyway.
-No problem.

61
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.720
I think it's a little cold here.

62
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.040
I think it's decent temperature, i.

63
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.360
I want to
to have it a little warmer.

64
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.600
Just sit, I'll take care of it.

65
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.200
My girl.

66
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.440
Dostangsystemet
is based on mutual trust.

67
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.040
Here is the body's most
private parts on exhibition.

68
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.240
It is everyone's responsibility
to stay away.

69
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:42.280
Yesterday we had an episode where
the dostang bandit was very daring.

70
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.280
Oddvar?

71
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:50.720
I sit on the dostanga, fit mine
own affairs, a sense of peace and no danger.

72
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.400
Suddenly a hand comes
shooting from the ground -

73
00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.280
- and begin to pet me in scrotum.

74
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.520
In a perfect world
had we had our own cubicle,

75
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.520
- but unfortunately we are not there yet.

76
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.320
Orm!
Come up here.

77
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:27.040
Now it is important that the entire chieftain
family stands together and shows disgust.

78
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.880
Yes.
First I must say that -

79
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.480
- my thoughts go to Oddvar
  and his closest.

80
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.680
But I think she's got her punishment -

81
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.280
- for what I call
  innocent foxes.

82
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.440
These are not foxes!
This is abuse.

83
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:54.640
The thought of her there
has stared me into the brown eye, -

84
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.320
- it's traumatic.
  Simply.

85
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.480
I'm going to have to work a lot
to get over this.

86
00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.400
But we know nothing
about her motivation.

87
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.680
-Maybe she has to expire for something.
-Orm ...

88
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.120
Maybe she has been kept outside
all my life, was excluded from things, -

89
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.760
- saw it sneaking around the dostanga
  is her way of feeling closeness.

90
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:34.560
So ... But what do I know? Nothing.
It becomes pure guess. A hypothesis.

91
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.760
Thanks for the input, Orm. But trust
is broken in a grim manner.

92
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.480
That's why we have to send
the dostang bandit to Helheim.

93
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.920
There doang bandits belong.

94
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.600
No!

95
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.320
Wait! Wait!
You've been fooled!

96
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.240
I shall say
who the dostang bandit is!

97
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.640
Yes, and it will ship
shock waves throughout Norheim.

98
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.600
There is no ...

99
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.360
The scrap bin frog, it's ...

100
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.880
I just lost some patience.
She pulled it a little too far.

101
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:45.240
She enjoyed being the centerpiece
a little too long for my taste.

102
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.720
Varg?

103
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.440
Varg!

104
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.080
Varg!

105
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.800
Varg?

106
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.480
Oi!

107
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.080
Nothing.
The eye looks absolutely fine.

108
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.320
How was the guild then?

109
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.960
Looks like things went a bit wrong.

110
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.200
-Take me home.
- Where's Reidun?

111
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.880
Your wife. Reidun.
Should she be home?

112
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.200
I want to go home.
Take me home.

113
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.760
Come on!
Get in and go!

114
00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.920
Food!
It is genital today.

115
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.440
-What do we say then?
-Thanks. Thank you.

116
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.960
Good!

117
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:57.000
It's fine with the marks in the bread,
but what is the taste, then?

118
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.320
He said it was genital.

119
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.640
So that's for sure
a taste of unwashed genitalia.

120
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.760
That he is bothering, that is.

121
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.840
Puns?
It's just so bad.

122
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.600
He's testing us for sure.
To see if we complain.

123
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.520
But I'm not going to break down.
I'll endure - for you.

124
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.400
In this miserable world you are
the only thing that keeps me up.

125
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.040
We have to work and struggle
for one day -

126
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.560
- then the Vikings understand
  that we deserve our freedom.

127
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.640
Did you know the chief
releases one slave family each year?

128
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.720
Why couldn't it be us this year?

129
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.720
You may want to mute
those expectations a bit, Arnstein.

130
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.440
Just know that anyway
whether we get that freedom or not,

131
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.040
- then I love you.

132
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:13.400
And I love you. So long
we stick together, we are strong.

133
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.080
Then there is nothing
that can break us.

134
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.680
(It crackles in a twig.)

135
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.600
-Hey Hey.
-Hi.

136
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.560
Orm!

137
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.880
Orm!

138
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:28.000
Come on.
I know you are here!

139
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.600
Orm?

140
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.800
Orm?

141
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.680
Orm!

142
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.960
Orm?

143
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.960
Orm?

144
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.520
-Orm.
-Hildur. Hello. How pretty you are today.

145
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.680
I just had to fix some stuff ...

146
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.400
What are you doing?
Did you dig those things here?

147
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.080
What are you doing?

148
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.920
I suggest we just
forget what has not happened.

149
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.920
I know very well what happened.
I knew you were the dostang bandit.

150
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.320
I? It must be allowed to crawl
around dostanga in underground caves -

151
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.760
- without being accused of anything.

152
00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.960
And he?
Which one did he eat?

153
00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.960
At first he ate one,
and then a great bit of this.

154
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.000
-It's deadly, then.
-It might have been the first one, too.

155
00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.400
Can't you eat it, Kark,
so we see what happens?

156
00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.160
It is no worse than that.

157
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.920
What are you doing?

158
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.960
We are trying to find out
what mushrooms are edible.

159
00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:03.200
Depending on how Kark is doing,
we have found a new one we can eat.

160
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.640
But Olav, you must come.

161
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.720
-The ax is going, Kark?
-It seems promising, this.

162
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.840
Orm!

163
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:35.360
-What do you have to say about this?
-Can't we focus on other things?

164
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:40.040
Can't we just
put the spotlight on something else?

165
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:46.800
Hiding behind the dostanga
and watching people turn away?

166
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.760
It doesn't get any worse than that.

167
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:56.800
You haven't just been staring ...
You took the life of an innocent lady.

168
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.600
If people know about this ...
At best, you become a bitch.

169
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:13.200
And it reflects so badly on me
as a sister-in-law. That's the most important thing.

170
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.720
The last thing I promised my dad before him
dead, was to make a man of you.

171
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.120
Oh yes?

172
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.120
But then it boiled
a bit off in the cabbage, really.

173
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.080
There was much else that was tempting.
A lot of stuff, really.

174
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.720
- Among other things ...
-But now it's time.

175
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.960
-No.
-Yes. You must join the cruise.

176
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.760
You must mutter, loot and:

177
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:02.400
You have to operate properly
Viking thing, not the pioneering.

178
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.880
Peony is my life!
I refuse! I hate you!

179
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.800
I'm your big brother
and your chieftain. I decide.

180
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.920
No, because I'm actually 18 years old!

181
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.440
Besides, Hildur and I have
decided to get married.

182
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.680
You have to get a wife
that can make you a man.

183
00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.360
-No.
-You said it yourself. You lack proximity.

184
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.520
I refuse!
It is not going to happen.

185
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.280
We're talking about someone who is
bound to you for the rest of your life.

186
00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.960
One you have to be with
all the way to death.

187
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.520
So much so?

188
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.040
Tied, almost, to me?

189
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:52.200
Never again alone and on
constant search for camaraderie?

190
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.040
Never again alone, Orm.

191
00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.800
And we know of one who had
suited you perfectly.

192
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.160
Who?

193
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:38.120
-Frøya, it's Chief Olav!
-And Hildur! First lady!

194
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.920
Let me take care of the talk.

195
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.160
Look here, yes.
Is this where you live, Frøya?

196
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.320
Nice space.
A lot of carcasses.

197
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.440
Are there any animals left
in the woods now, then?

198
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.400
Yes.

199
00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.400
Yes, since you've shot so many animals.
A nice comment.

200
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.040
Yes, it's expensive again.

201
00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.200
I'm just going straight to the point, me.

202
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:16.560
Well, now it feels like that
My brother, Orm, has become single -

203
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.160
- and then it opens
  an incredibly exciting opportunity.

204
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.840
Orm, did you say?

205
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.800
- Don't think I've met him.
-A man of honor.

206
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:33.800
Or he has the potential to be
if conditions are rectified.

207
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:39.440
-So he's not a man of honor now?
- No, but he will be.

208
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.280
And had to take care of Odin
that I get stabbed in the stomach -

209
00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:48.040
- and the intestines ripped out,
  if he doesn't.

210
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.600
I think I'm taking over the talk, me.
Go for a walk and we'll talk to the ladies a little.

211
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.360
Here's how we do it.

212
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.400
Frøya...

213
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.960
- The worm is perfect for you.
-Oh well?

214
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:14.000
Frøya ... And you're perfect for him.
He needs you.

215
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.800
-Why?
-He needs a lady with a bone in her nose.

216
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.480
Which is a little rough at the edges
and can rush him out of his comfort zone -

217
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.480
- and elicit some new interests.

218
00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:35.560
- New interests?
- Get him interested in this ...

219
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.040
Not pigeonholes, color fabrics
and make flower garlands.

220
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.600
Does not sound
as a perfect match for me.

221
00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:51.440
Frøya, that's exactly what it is.
Opposites attract each other.

222
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.000
- Opposites attract each other.
- Never heard.

223
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.840
It is just read and adopted.

224
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:04.440
Don't you want to move to Norheim, then?
And don't stay out here in gambling?

225
00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.200
Get yourself a longhouse and slaves and ...

226
00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.120
All the food you want, clothes and ...

227
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.440
Everything you have to work so hard for now.

228
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.720
I hear what you're saying.
But I'm not interested.

229
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.480
-If you could fit in ...
- Let it marinate a bit, then.

230
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:30.560
And think about
hunting for animals is optimal, -

231
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.800
- or if there is something better
  to carry on?

232
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:44.280
-It was quite okay then?
-You could command her, then.

233
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:48.440
-You have a slightly weak leadership style at the moment.
-Do you think?

234
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:53.600
When you are so elusive,
wipes my pussy a little, that is.

235
00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.280
Does it?

236
00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.720
And to say that Odin can stab you
unless Orm becomes an honorary man ...

237
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:07.400
No, I was a little torn with it.
I wouldn't worry about it.

238
00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.400
Odin has better things to deal with
than listen to everything I say.

239
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.440
Here, Wolf.
Here I have a heat bottle.

240
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.320
Like that.

241
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.840
-Is it true that I have holes in my hat?
-What?

242
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.880
No.

243
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.440
I want to see.
Give me a sword.

244
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.200
-Et ...?
-Sword. I can't say!

245
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:46.760
You've been through a traumatic one
experience. That r comes back.

246
00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.680
Oh! Skull ...
I've been bald.

247
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.800
Indeed. I never have
noticed. New to me.

248
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.120
You've been fighting me for years.

249
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.800
Du Varg ...
Should I be honest with you,

250
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.480
- you look much nicer
  with a solid moon.

251
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:25.160
You will be much more interesting ...
Yes, people get curious about you.

252
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.360
You, what are they saying?
Change joy?

253
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.720
No one has started saying that.
