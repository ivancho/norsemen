1
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.480
I'm looking forward to going insane.
Worms are so extremely intense during the day.

2
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.160
- Just a run from it.
- Run from him?

3
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.280
That's what we've always done.

4
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.840
Freya. I've packed tents and skins,
so if we find flowers ...

5
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.480
Don't join.

6
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.240
Yes. And with goat's milk we avoid
wounds in our hands when we rent.

7
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.640
Olav!
Should he join?

8
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.920
Yes. Worm is the main goddess.
But he should not fly in your legs.

9
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.760
Worm, you know what? You have to lead
the senior battalion in this battle.

10
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.200
-What? Should the girl lead us?
-Yes.

11
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.000
There is some miscommunication.
I stay in the tent and clear and arrange.

12
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.520
But now you have to give it a try.
It will be so good, Orm!

13
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.840
Now wait a minute. It is not safe
that it's such a bad idea.

14
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.280
Worm is the least experienced after all
the warrior throughout Norheim.

15
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.760
Who is better to lead us
to the safe death than Orm?

16
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.080
Although I have
a couple of good years again -

17
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.920
- that's my last chance
  to die with dignity.

18
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.800
And not peaceful in a bed
with friends and loved ones around me.

19
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.440
-He's our ticket to Valhall.
-For Orm!

20
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.840
Arvid, think we're going on a trip together.
It is fun.

21
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.400
That was about time.

22
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.560
I certainly invited you
for at least a hundred nights, -

23
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.440
- but then you have never been able to.
  But now we did it. Full flap.

24
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.560
I'm looking crazy
to see you in contention.

25
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.640
Fight and fight, you solve well
inconsistencies verbally.

26
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.240
No, we solve
most conflicts of power.

27
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.240
But in most cases
one talks through it.

28
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.160
Take it here, you.

29
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.000
Nothing is more beautiful than a stroke.

30
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.800
No, this will be fine, Varg.

31
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.720
This day
it must be chanted forever.

32
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.000
When Norway learned to abide
too good to spread rumors -

33
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.280
- about that individuals
  has become thin in the hair!

34
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.000
- Is that what we're about to fight here?
- Oh yes, so absolutely.

35
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.400
Either way, you just don't say that.

36
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.280
Then you go in person and not matter,
and it's not okay. Bad style.

37
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.400
Really unfinished.

38
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.280
Jarl Bjørn!
Your pig fur!

39
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.160
Smart move to lead
all piglets to the slaughterhouse!

40
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.320
Hush! Hush! I hear
not a word of what he says!

41
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.160
What?
Should burn your ugly hair!

42
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.640
And your dickskin
should I stretch and dry and make ...

43
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.760
-I hear nothing.
-No ...

44
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.280
Orphans!

45
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.480
You have to talk louder!
I don't hear a crack!

46
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.640
Hush, hush, he says something.

47
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.320
... your hairless whore!

48
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.160
I can not hear what you're saying!
You need to speak louder ...

49
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.520
You're too far away!
Voice usage does not match the distance!

50
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.160
This becomes too impractical.
Come on, Dog.

51
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.600
He wants to talk.

52
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.280
You don't want me to
take care of the talk?

53
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.320
I certainly won't.

54
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.400
- Do you think it will take a long time?
- It takes the time it takes.

55
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.920
Because we were in front of the army, I saw
couldn't pee until we stepped forward.

56
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.280
So now it's pretty precarious.

57
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.240
I just let it go in my pants, me.
Then I don't have to think about it anymore.

58
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.960
(Pee Sounds)

59
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.040
There!

60
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.960
Bear, Bear, Bear.

61
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.840
So sad.
My best friend became my worst enemy.

62
00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.760
Your goodness, your humanity, your whole
Your personality certainly stuck in your hair.

63
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.000
-A stubborn version of yourself.
-You are a stubborn version of you!

64
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:19.240
Had I been like you, I had
pointed out how ugly your burn is!

65
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.400
But I don't.
I rise above personal attacks.

66
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:32.160
I'll give you a chance to save
the lives of thousands of innocents.

67
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.320
All I demand is an apology.

68
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.240
-To lay your toad.
-I apologize?

69
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.480
It is me who is
the offended party here.

70
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:53.080
Wolf, you burned and killed the whole thing
my relatives. You disfigured my face.

71
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.000
It's a little more serious
than a little comment about hair loss.

72
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.200
There were concerns about my inability.

73
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.720
- My hair was outstanding.
- No, not unique.

74
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.800
Yes!
Until you sabotage it!

75
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.320
You had a beginning moon.
Depart from here to Helheim.

76
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.640
I just pointed out the obvious.
Everyone saw it. Yes.

77
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.640
How should your hair loss
be my mistake?

78
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.000
It will be easy.

79
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.440
You said I had become ...

80
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.960
Thin in the string.
This led to a stress reaction.

81
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.240
And it started a process -

82
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.520
- that made ...

83
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.800
... that my hair just fell out.

84
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.240
There were trolls in words!

85
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.720
There were trolls in words.
And that was your fault.

86
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.680
It is nothing
called "troll in words", Varg.

87
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.520
- Is there no troll in words?
-No.

88
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.640
What about dragons?

89
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.160
Do you believe in dragons?

90
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.080
What?

91
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.160
Do you believe in dragons?

92
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.800
You? Did you say that with dragons
because we have a dragon on our team?

93
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.720
-Yes.
-Correct.

94
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.440
And you planned that reply
all the way, or did you improvise now?

95
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:06.000
One hundred percent script-based. One so
great replica is impossible to improvise.

96
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.720
So good. I'm just trying to learn a little.
One day maybe I'll be earl.

97
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.560
It is okay
to be able to do the tricks.

98
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.440
It is never going to happen.
Just forget it.

99
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.760
Yes.

100
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.680
What's up?
What do we do now?

101
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.360
Now we wait for the dragon.

102
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.000
On the dragon?

103
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.080
Yes. It's my secret weapon.

104
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.800
And it will burn by the whole army
Jarl Bjørn without losing one man.

105
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.920
OK.

106
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.160
- So that's our plan?
-Yes.

107
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.920
I really never have
believed in dragons, i.

108
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.560
I have to admit
that I thought dragons were fabulous animals.

109
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.560
-Did you see it with your own eyes?
-No.

110
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.800
But I've seen drawings of it.

111
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.440
I know what it's capable of.

112
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:35.120
-But you haven't seen it, somehow?
- It was violent then.

113
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.640
No, I haven't seen it.
But as I said:

114
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.960
I have seen
extremely fine drawings of it.

115
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.600
I'll take a look over there.

116
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.800
Yes, then we go
and look for a dragon.

117
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.560
-Drag ...
-OK.

118
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.560
-Jarl Varg.
- So there you are finally, dragon lady.

119
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.760
-You spent your time.
- It's no use stressing a dragon.

120
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:26.880
-When will it come?
-No, well, she should be here now.

121
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.280
But she's safe here
every moment.

122
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.200
I'm starting to lose
the belief in this dragon.

123
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.400
You can't say to a dragon
an exact time.

124
00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:02.320
Can you tell your horse that it must
stay home exactly until midnight?

125
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.680
No, animals don't
the time perspective that we have.

126
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.880
-There!
-Where?

127
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.880
There!

128
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.760
No, it's just an eagle or something.
Sorry.

129
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.800
- It's a seagull.
-Sorry.

130
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.840
So you think you can
humiliate me with your lies?

131
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.840
-What do you mean?
-Keep me for fun with drawings?

132
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.120
-False expectations?
-Seriously?

133
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.560
- The dragon doesn't exist, does it?
- Wear is fine. Trust me.

134
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:48.880
You can just forget that! I have all-
nest been failed once too much!

135
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.480
Look!

136
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.640
- There it is. Behind you.
-Don't turn around!

137
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.920
She has kept us for fun enough.
I'm putting down a reverse ban!

138
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.680
- Just turn around, it's right behind you.
-No, this is an order!

139
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:11.240
-What's wrong with you?
-Don't turn around!

140
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.360
- Turn around, then.
- Tighten the bows!

141
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.280
Hi Hi Hi ...

142
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.240
This is too stupid.
Turn around, it's behind you.

143
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.000
We don't turn around!
Now it is a matter of principle.

144
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.280
This is almost like in Æsop,
just the opposite.

145
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.760
Turn around,
then you see that I speak true.

146
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.840
No!

147
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.080
Shoot!

148
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.920
There, the teats punctured. Poff.

149
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.560
It's a little important to ask,
because if there is a rule on it ...

150
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.360
My whole plan is useless.

151
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.280
We're going to go for it
a good old fashioned design.

152
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.600
-Despe-stroke?
-Storming with weapons in hand.

153
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:54.360
Piercing impact. Bowels that are ripped out
of bodies, lots of screaming and death.

154
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.360
A classic
unclear Middle Ages -

155
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.400
- where you hardly
  sees the difference between friend and foe.

156
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.760
Is it allowed to go berserk?

157
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:12.120
- Is it allowed to get a little wild?
- Oh, it's allowed to get lost.

158
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.000
It is allowed to get very wild.

159
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.480
- Then we will.
-Go ahead.

160
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.880
-Innsmett?
-Go ahead.

161
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.800
What if I lead the senior battalion
through the forest there -

162
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:53.520
- and comes out the back
  Jarl Bjorn's army? A rubbish maneuver?

163
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.440
-You are thinking of a flank maneuver?
-Yes. Just. Ten points for you.

164
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.760
Well thought out, Orm.
Well thought out.

165
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:07.240
-I am very sorry for that.
-Very good initiative.

166
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.800
Senior Battalion, you join Orm!

167
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.200
Do you notice?
The race step pulses somewhat violently.

168
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.800
As if the heartbeats
down there, -

169
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:53.360
- as if the heart is down in the middle-
  meat. Then there is a fighting situation.

170
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.400
-Do they notice it too?
-No.

171
00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:02.800
-I know nothing about the perineum.
-Your race step is just the thing.

172
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:09.320
Either way is not the right time
or place to investigate it now.

173
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.360
Follow me.
Now it should be flanked!

174
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.920
We can't stop now!
We must get behind Jarl Bjørn.

175
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.920
Do not breathe.
Then we are put out of play.

176
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.720
And a little tired warrior
is a dead warrior.

177
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.720
- I think we should be taken to the right.
- No, just follow me.

178
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.360
- We are farther away now.
-We don't hear the battle anymore.

179
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:26.120
In the forest you can be fooled by the sound.
Everything is closer than you think.

180
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.920
-No, it is not.
- Yes, in the forest it is like that. Follow me.

181
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.800
(Bird Acknowledge)

182
00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.440
See!

183
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.000
-A squirrel.
-So what?

184
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.640
Fast! Find some nuts for it.

185
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.400
Why in the world
Shall we feed a squirrel now?

186
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:32.120
I have a creeping feeling
that it will be crucial.

187
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:39.000
-This is just buzz.
- Oddvar, I'm leading the battalion.

188
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.680
All together, I command you:
Find nuts now.

189
00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.560
Stop.
Save his piss. Jarl Bjørn is mine.

190
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.600
Orm. I said yes
that we should be taken to the right.

191
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.280
Hindsight is
the world's most accurate science.

192
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:27.080
Now we could sit at the table
in cheerful passion with Tor and Odin.

193
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.920
Would Odin have had you at the table,
had you been sitting there.

194
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:37.600
-You should lead us to the battle.
- Then Odin intervened, because he does.

195
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:45.320
He is Odin and does so. He
intervenes when needed for the intervention.

196
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.360
Jogrim?

197
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.560
Geir Tore!
Geir Tore?

198
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.920
Brynjar?
Brynjar, are you here?

199
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.760
Haldor?
Haldor, are you ...

200
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.880
How do you know you're not
do people on our team kill now?

201
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.160
We don't exactly have uniforms.

202
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.840
Do not know.
I recognize our guys.

203
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.520
-Do you recognize 20.000 men like that?
-Yes.

204
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.600
You then?

205
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:59.160
-Is it you who killed him, right?
- If I killed him? No.

206
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:05.080
-Why do you ask?
-Good. It's Gisle, namely.

207
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.160
We usually go on trips together.

208
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:15.720
And other occasions throughout the year.
Christmas tables and things like that.

209
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.840
But in ... Someone's got the cut
the piss off he too! Who does that?

210
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.320
I don't know, I do.

211
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.960
Look at that.

212
00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.920
Harald?

213
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.600
I've just walked into my own world
and run the sword in everything that moves.

214
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.240
I thought everyone who was like that,
were ours -

215
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.760
- and those who were like that,
  was on Jarl Bjorn's team.

216
00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:56.840
Me too.
It's kind of wrong, now, then.

217
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.160
- Hi, Frøya, girlfriend.
-Orm? You managed?

218
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.160
Jeps.

219
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.240
I didn't see it coming.
Good work.

220
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:31.800
Not without scrapes. You have not
been in contention before bleeding from the feet.

221
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.280
Great to get their first battle scar.

222
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.880
-That's a nagging year.
- That's your truth.

223
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.800
- In my truth, it's a battle scar.
-Oh well.

224
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.040
Think about it, Frøya,
we have participated in battles together.

225
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:55.680
It is very, very romantic
and at the same time very barbaric.

226
00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.120
- Now we're brothers in contention.
-How did the flanking go?

227
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.200
Good. Good.
They never saw us coming.

228
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.440
Good.

229
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:15.360
You have to get everything out here,
so it doesn't start to smell.

230
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.960
When you get a wife,
then shut up ...

231
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.160
Hi!

232
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.880
A tyrant is overturned!
A bully is cleared of the way.

233
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:42.520
My wife's indirect killer
has finally become my prisoner.

234
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.440
And this must be celebrated
with a guild in Vargnes!

235
00:26:53.360 --> 00:27:00.240
We had really started to think
on the chorus, vi. We have some sores.

236
00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.040
- Would have been nice to get home.
-That is an order!

237
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:11.200
-Of course.
-The guild begins tomorrow.

238
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:16.440
-Greit!
- Then we'll just unpack again, you guys!

239
00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:21.000
- Really detour to go to ...
-Do not say anything.

240
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.840
We can't even wash ourselves.
Hopeless.

241
00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:32.160
Now I feel like our relationship
begins to take shape.

242
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.200
You think so?

243
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:39.800
We are a couple like that
all other couples are envious of.

244
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.400
But anyway,
now it's time for some cuddling.
