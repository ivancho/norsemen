1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.960
Yes, the next one is for Arvid.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.600
How many times
does the Midgardworm go around Midgard?

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.800
- Mr. Tor, it's too easy!
- It bites itself in the tail. A round.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.320
Just right, Arvid.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.200
-Frøya, so nice!
-I'm doing it.

6
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.240
-What?
- Marry me with Orm.

7
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.360
So good.
Good choice. Smart.

8
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.600
On one condition:
I need to join your shepherd.

9
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.720
- You guys?
-I'll be on all trips.

10
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.160
I have to join
to loot and mutilate.

11
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.360
Yes, it might
be a little difficult.

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.680
-Why?
-Because ...

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.000
Partly because
the shepherd is full.

14
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.360
Hello, we can't
Have your friends in the yard.

15
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.760
-Why not?
-There are many reasons for that.

16
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.120
- Give me one, then.
-Girls can't fight.

17
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.440
-Yes it is true.
-And cruising is a lot about infringement.

18
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.960
- Rape is our trademark.
- Got it with me.

19
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.400
Are you going to argue with the ass?
It can't be done.

20
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.200
The kisses go in after all.

21
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.400
Frøya.

22
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.920
-Welcome abord.
-Thanks.

23
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.640
- See you on a cruise, then.
-But it's a wedding first, then.

24
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.680
The trick is not to look at the ladies,
pretend it is the most natural ...

25
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.880
It is no worse than that.
Single.

26
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.120
Hi, Arvid.
Do you drink lots of water?

27
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.280
No, it's mead.
We are full on day. Heard of it?

28
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.600
Drinking during the day,
it is the best filling.

29
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.120
Maybe a little irresponsible?
Since you are Olav's right hand.

30
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.680
You are such a wild bass as that
refuses to grow up and lives in the present.

31
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.520
But you have a boyish charm
which makes it impossible to get mad at you.

32
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.440
Yes, but that's it. Did you see
avoids all consequences -

33
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.280
- which could have been
  a valuable lesson.

34
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.960
Then you only see if you change your mind
when you are forced to take responsibility.

35
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.720
-I doubt it!
-Propos it - I'll get married.

36
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.920
- Then I need a groom.
-Exactly.

37
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.920
-Olav. You should ask Olav about it.
-Yes, I did.

38
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.240
But he thought it would be unhealthy
for us to bond even stronger ties.

39
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.200
That I should tie ties
to others and blah-blah-blah.

40
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.920
So then I thought of you. I feel
that you and I have begun to find the tone.

41
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.200
No we have not. And it doesn't work,
because I don't believe in marriage.

42
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.960
I'm one of those kind
which goes from lady to lady.

43
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.960
A round burner that breaks hearts.

44
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.720
- At least in theory.
-So you're on board?

45
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.320
-No.
-You just have to think about it?

46
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.600
- No, I don't need it.
A little?

47
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.680
I do not want to.

48
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.800
It'll be great, there.

49
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.560
Ragnar!
Fy Odin, how nice you were now.

50
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.000
Really delicious you are.

51
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.440
-What?
For the ladies. Ladies' sweetie.

52
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.720
-I know.
-Looks like your masculine look.

53
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.120
You preach to the choir, but what do you want?

54
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.400
I'm going to get married, and then
is it that you need a friend -

55
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.360
- who has always been there,
  and will always be there -

56
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.720
- and that stands as a support for me, -

57
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.880
- so if you want to do me
  the honor of becoming my fiancee?

58
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.400
Yes, but then it's just the two of us.
So then the choice is very simple.

59
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:59.200
Eagle, will you do me
the great honor of being mine - the groom?

60
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.080
It can be a little difficult now, Orm.
I almost have to get the knife loose -

61
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.760
- and stop the bleeding.

62
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.560
- After that, then?
- Wound treatment and rehabilitation.

63
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.520
Finding rooms is difficult
to be your fiancee now.

64
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.880
Unfortunately.

65
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.520
Be silly, that.

66
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.520
Au ...

67
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.760
I wondered if maybe
you would be my fiancee?

68
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.360
OK, now they come.
Then we smile and show our best side.

69
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.320
Then the day has come.
Release day.

70
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.000
Who's done it
most deserving of being set free?

71
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.480
-Kark, you're always up there.
- No, no, others deserve it more.

72
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.400
Maybe one of the families?
They can create a full life.

73
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.800
That's a very nice point.
Arnstein slave?

74
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.640
You and your family have to work harder
than anyone else without complaining.

75
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:47.080
Quite exemplary, they say. You have
made you most deserving of freedom.

76
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.560
Oh! Is it true?
Thank you very, very much!

77
00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:00.040
We have done everything we can to please you.
We really appreciate that!

78
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:07.120
And on a regular release day
I should have given you freedom now.

79
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.840
But this year it has
something a little special happened.

80
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.720
One here in the village has offered me
a considerable amount of silver -

81
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.480
- to release one particular slave,
  and it is little honor to refuse it.

82
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:29.200
Olvar, do you want to come?
Can you tell us what you think?

83
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.960
Yes, it is
a little badly kept secret -

84
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:41.120
- that I've had a good eye
  to one of you for a long time.

85
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.880
And she,
because it's a "she" -

86
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:51.600
- have let me try her
  a good number of times.

87
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.600
And I have been
extremely well satisfied with.

88
00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.600
It has been incredibly delicious ...

89
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.160
-You talk a little bit about the porridge now.
-Exactly.

90
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.040
Sorry.
Where was I?

91
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.520
The one I want to buy free -

92
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.520
- is Liv.

93
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.800
Life? What does he mean by that?
What is happening now?

94
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.800
Can you hold him for a while?

95
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.040
You're welcome.

96
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.120
Life, what's going on?

97
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.320
I'm the first to complain
that it stayed that way here.

98
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.640
But it's about me refusing
to compromise with myself.

99
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.200
The last thing I want is to hurt you.
- Don't do this, then.

100
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.760
Yes, but now Liv must
Think about Liv again.

101
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.120
The whole family could be released!
Think so traumatizing for the kids.

102
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.440
You, Liv have made his decision.

103
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:17.040
It's incredibly bad style of you
to push your kids in front of you like that.

104
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:23.320
I understand why she is
choose you away, to put it that way.

105
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.680
Do not take it personally.
Can't you be happy on my behalf?

106
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.800
I am going to be a big farmer's wife, and I can
don't have a bad conscience with me.

107
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:41.120
Good. You probably have enough to do.
Next year is another year.

108
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.680
Life!

109
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:53.000
Listen, she'll get enough
a backlash when she realizes -

110
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.880
- that social position and material
  goods do not replace love.

111
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.360
- Do you think so?
-Yes. Love overcomes everything.

112
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.760
OK.

113
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:21.400
I do not know, but I am impressed
to see families being torn apart.

114
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.080
Although it's mundane now.

115
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.160
But slaves do not have feelings like us.
They are more like fish.

116
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.440
Yes, but I always have to
Think of the brother.

117
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.960
-Me?
-No. Our big brother.

118
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.600
- Do I have more brothers than you?
-I told you about Karl.

119
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.360
-Never heard of.
-Never heard of. Tell then.

120
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.200
Karl was a baby when Norheim was threatened,
and was sent north -

121
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.960
- to preserve the chief's blood.

122
00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.880
To show that Karl
was heir to Norheim, -

123
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.280
- they tattooed
  an N-rune on his back.

124
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.760
So traumatizing!

125
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.400
They do not drive and sew pillows
under the arms of the kids then.

126
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.240
It's a little unclear what happened.
I was born, so they forgot about him.

127
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:25.520
But there was a rumor that Karl
was captured and sold as a slave.

128
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.160
My own brother?
A slave from the north?

129
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.520
After all, that's a cruel thought.
Imagine if he's trolling around somewhere now!

130
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.080
-And speak a completely different dialect.
-Fun.

131
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:47.320
I was also sent north,
and I have a tattoo on my back ...

132
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:53.480
Don't mix your dirty slave story
with our proud family history.

133
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.480
It becomes totally reprehensible.

134
00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:02.240
Sorry. It's just the affinity I've felt
that speaks.

135
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.240
We can sell you at any time,
so do not feel very belonging.

136
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.000
Sorry.

137
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.560
If this brother comes home
one day - will he be the chief?

138
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.920
Yes yes. On the rap.

139
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.040
And the wife becomes the chieftain?

140
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.520
Absolutely.

141
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.200
Right?

142
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.000
Hello.
We're looking for a Jarl Varg, we.

143
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.400
Is he home, maybe?

144
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.520
Jarl Varg.

145
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:15.880
Must be a pleasant one
and jovial type with rich hair.

146
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:22.680
- Really classic Viking hair.
-Do you start getting thin in the string?

147
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.000
Oi.

148
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.160
I'm Jarl Varg.

149
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.360
Now you're humming, Grandpa.
You do not fit the description.

150
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.760
-Can I help you with anything?
-Yes, we're looking for Jarl Varg.

151
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.440
This is Jarl Varg.

152
00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.200
But he just is
an old, bald man.

153
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:06.400
For information is his weld
a conscious choice made by hair fashion.

154
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.360
-Do you call that hair fashion?
-Yes.

155
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.880
In a time where men
has long hair and a full beard -

156
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.480
- the hairlessness makes him
  into a kind of rebel.

157
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.200
I agree with the theory,
But hair fashion is more complex.

158
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.480
It's about individualism.

159
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:33.880
Take me - I use my hair like that
accessories with a certain length in front.

160
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:39.240
Then you have a statement, then.
Man he has cut away everything.

161
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.000
It lacks credibility.
Zero content.

162
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.000
It's not hair fashion,
just a clean haircut.

163
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:53.200
A face tattoo to combine
the stuff - it could have been anything.

164
00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:00.680
But ... What was I supposed to say?
Chief Olav of Norheim -

165
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:06.400
- wondering about Jarl Varg
  have any plans for two full moons?

166
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.760
Two full moons?
Lets see.

167
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:17.640
Two full moons ...
No, Varg's prime looks open, of course.

168
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.840
So good. For Chief Olavs
little brother Orm is getting married.

169
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.680
Here is the invitation.

170
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:32.480
Then there will be stag parties
and a wedding party about two full moons.

171
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.360
No ... I'm busy.
I am busy.

172
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.880
I can see again, me.
Should we see, shall we see ...

173
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.560
No, it's completely open there.
Nothing on the agenda.

174
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.880
So I think wedding sounds good.

175
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.280
Now I have to take in Varg,
for it draws. So we'll see.

176
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.880
Yes. Bye for now.

177
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.840
-Yes, it's going so well.
-I was preoccupied ...

178
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:17.560
-Yes, Hildur. Something I can do?
- Just pull up the sack.

179
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:23.200
Should I be violated? I have flat lice,
ticks, mushrooms and infectious stuff -

180
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.880
- but think positively,
  you will not be infected.

181
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.560
No, Kark, I should just
give yourself a break with the whip.

182
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.760
Well thought out.
Any special occasion?

183
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.840
It's mostly about having to
is reminded of its role in new and ne.

184
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:46.760
Clever thought. I got a little warm in
shirt, talk without being talked to.

185
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.920
Insert!

186
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.400
Perfect.
Not too much pain sounds now, then.

187
00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.760
Au ...

188
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:23.400
And here we have a leaflet.
One of the finest.

189
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:32.320
Life, I'd appreciate if you were
a little more engaged in making herbarium.

190
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.120
Lord Tor, you are bored with me.
I almost miss slavery.

191
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.120
Surely that should not be possible.

192
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.400
-Yes?
-Yes, you have a visit.

193
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.520
So good.

194
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:07.280
Out with him, Arnstein. Life
don't like staring at her. Out!

195
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.600
When Pop!

196
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.600
Man, how quiet it was here, then.

197
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:26.640
Isn't that Arvid himself?
Norheim's faithful protector -

198
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:33.040
- and by far the most facial teat
  person? What brings you here?

199
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.320
Worm should marry,
so we invite to a wedding.

200
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:44.120
How fun. After all, we are newly in love and
newlyweds themselves. Have you greeted Liv?

201
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.920
-No. Hello.
-Hi. Oi! That was his handshake.

202
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.560
Maybe something to learn here for you, Olvar?

203
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:59.880
To greet you is like picking
up a glass jug. With all due respect.

204
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.400
He would like to invite
to the stag team too.

205
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.720
Stag team - I've been to it.
Like a slave. Then it went away.

206
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.280
-Yes.
-Oh well.

207
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.440
Yes, it was hand hunters and finger-driving
and mating and so on -

208
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.560
- if you absolutely
  I would have to be concrete.

209
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:28.000
-Yes, but ...
-Rape of slaves is after the book.

210
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.920
 It is permissible in custom.

211
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.800
But you probably have many to visit ...

212
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.480
Can't handle the heat,
so get out of the kitchen!

213
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.440
Or the family room,
to be more timely.

214
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:52.400
- It seemed like a nice lady, that.
-Yes absolutely. Slightly sharp at the edges.

215
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:59.400
But she thinks so very well.
She is very good at the bottom.

216
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:05.000
She just needs to
some time to adjust.

217
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:11.960
"Tempted", right? It is not
 just to suddenly become human.

218
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:17.400
- After many years as a sub-human.
-Of course.

219
00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.240
So that's the best thing
that has happened to me.

220
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.440
But I have a small job
to do there, I see it.

221
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.880
It will be alright.
But see you at the stag team, then!

222
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.920
I just have to take
a little round with Liv on it.

223
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:42.000
But I expect it ...
She's so good at things like that.

224
00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.000
See you there!

225
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.120
He's not coming.

226
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.760
Guaranteed.

227
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.840
We'll see.

228
00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.240
Oh! Au ...

229
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.280
Like that.
Then I think we were there, me.

230
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.000
- Enjoy yourself then, Kark.
-Thanks.

231
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.800
Chief Olav?

232
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.440
It's something I've gnawed at
a little on, so can I talk openly?

233
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.800
You're my favorite thrall,
so talk as openly as you want.

234
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:49.240
Just that I'm wondering
if we might be brothers.

235
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.840
-I think I'm your brother.
-What are you talking about?

236
00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:00.760
The story you told about your
big brother who was sold as a slave ...

237
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.680
That was exactly it
that happened to me.

238
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.920
Yes, but Karl had
an N-rune tattooed on the back.

239
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.880
But I know, too
a large N-rune on the back.

240
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:19.600
-What? Do you have an N-rune on your back?
-Yes, they say so.

241
00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:27.200
If you have an N on your back,
you are Karl.

242
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.280
- Then we are brothers.
-Yes.

243
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.360
You're my big brother.

244
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.360
I have goose bumps, i.
Don't you?

245
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.480
Yes.

246
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.680
We just have to
find out right away.

247
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:06.280
No, it's very ...
I can't see if this is an N.

248
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:12.120
It might as well be an H.
It is absolutely impossible to say.

249
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:19.640
What a pity. Then we can't know
definitely. Then we must leave it at that.

250
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.720
Yes yes. Of course.

251
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.200
We can't be 100 percent sure,
is it neatest.

252
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.080
It's okay to try it, then.

253
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:36.760
-The piss pot is reasonably full, Kark.
-Yes of course.

254
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:52.040
Yes, so incredibly nice to see
so many near and dear ones here.

255
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:57.280
As you probably know, so
it was important to find a groom -

256
00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:04.680
- who were motivated for the task,
  and one who knew me best of all.

257
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:10.240
Then I made a conscious choice
and chose myself to be my fiance.

258
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.880
It was a very good choice, then!
Now we are looking forward, Orm.

259
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:21.280
Yes. They say
that a successful stag team -

260
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.320
- consists of the following ingredients:

261
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:30.640
A little spoonful of love,
a sword of friendship.

262
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:37.560
One sprinkles over some camaraderie
and a big cup of quad, -

263
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:45.120
- and finally you touch some tiny ones,
  tiny clips with male talk.

264
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.000
- Very creative.
- Very creative, this.

265
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:56.400
So hold on, because here comes
a program that is absolutely perfect -

266
00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:04.480
- for us men who like to sex
  on the ladies when the swab is tight.

267
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.920
-I like it.
-Agree with that. Sex is very delicious.

268
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.200
Good.
Tick ​​off for people talk ...

269
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.560
Very structured and great, then.

270
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.560
As you remember,
then you should bring one thing -

271
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.080
- which reminds you
  the first meeting with me.

272
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.080
Who will start?
Olav, you might want to ...

273
00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.680
Yes.
I begin.

274
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.480
I brought that stick here.

275
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:44.120
It reminds me a lot
about you when you were a kid.

276
00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.520
You often walked around with a stick?

277
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.720
Pin-Finn?
Do you remember Pinne-Finn?

278
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:58.560
Of course. Yes yes.
Stick-Finn was a good stick.

279
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.400
No, it ... There you really met
the nail on the head, Olav.

280
00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.760
- I almost have to hug.
-Afterwards.

281
00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.600
But it was ...
Next.

282
00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.080
I have one thing for you, Orm.

283
00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:23.720
After all, I usually run
with hard body work, -

284
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:29.640
- but I've used the tiny one
  I have free time on a gift for you.

285
00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.320
Instead of sleeping in a way ...

286
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.080
Kark. We humans have one
much higher standard than you, -

287
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:43.520
- so what can you have made that
  will have the least impact on me?

288
00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.920
No, of course, sorry.
You're absolutely right. My mistake.

289
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.880
Of course it's your fault.
- I'm laying flat.

290
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:28.640
Varg?
Do you think we can sit where we want?

291
00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.320
Or do they have table cards?

292
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.560
If they have table cards, it is
not sure we can sit together.

293
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.920
Now we're missing out
the stag team too.

294
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.120
Would have been a nice occasion
to get to know people.

295
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:53.840
But no then.
Now, like all strangers.

296
00:28:53.920 --> 00:29:01.200
You know as well as I do
is lousy to mingle and chat.

297
00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.000
That's right.

298
00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.320
I can't break
the chat code, that is.

299
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.720
Maybe I can talk about the weather?

300
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.480
Say I hope it doesn't happen
to be equally cool going forward and like that.

301
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.320
-It's always a winner.
-Yes ...

302
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:32.960
Then I go for the weather, me.
The right and the plain.

303
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.000
Weather and wind.

304
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.920
The drinking horn points,
must share their best sex tip.

305
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.160
That is, something you do
when sex, which the ladies dig.

306
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.000
As the ladies dig.
Do we have to?

307
00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.280
- Yeah, it's cool.
-OK. Go!

308
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.280
Orm! Your best sex tips.
This will be good.

309
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.520
Yes ... The best? Not just
one of all the things I do,

310
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.200
- but the very best?

311
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:24.200
Yes, very, very best
as the ladies dig.

312
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.520
Yes, something I'm very good at -

313
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.760
- is to knead bread.

314
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.760
-OK.
- I'm really handy.

315
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:45.000
-And that's kind of good?
-Yes, I grab the teats -

316
00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:50.120
- and acne and acne
  all that straps and clothes can hold -

317
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:56.320
- until the milk syringe stands out,
  and that's what is called climax.

318
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.600
That's the ultimate
a lady can experience.

319
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.680
Because then rinse
a cascade of lustful out.

320
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:11.800
So that's my little tip,
my little secret.

321
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.640
Yes. Great. Wow ...

322
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:22.200
I thought ... I wonder if we should
bick now, so we're not so tired.

323
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.400
It's early, it's sunny
and we've just begun.

324
00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:32.840
Shall we not sit in late night hours
and bowls and drinks and the stuff there?

325
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.880
In a perfect world we should,

326
00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:41.360
- but it's the groom who has
  added this to the day before the wedding.

327
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.440
Oh yes. There you go.

328
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:49.680
It's almost indefensible
to drive on longer.

329
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:54.840
I wonder if I should bicker too.
It's a day tomorrow too.

330
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.040
At least I want to get the most out of it.

331
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.880
This was super fun.
We have to do that again, Orm.

332
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.280
Yes, tomorrow is the wedding,
but the night after that?

333
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:12.080
- Then we're probably a little tired.
-But the next day, then?

334
00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.000
We'll see.
You're tired, aren't you?

335
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.480
Sleep well then.

336
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:24.000
Kark, sit there.
Sit there.

337
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.960
And then you laugh.

338
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.600
More.

339
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.360
(He whistles.)
