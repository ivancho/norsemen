1
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.360
I've been dreaming of this day
ever since you teased my hair.

2
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.520
Simple logic indicates that the hairpin
yours will follow you to Valhall. Go ahead.

3
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.320
Cut off his hair.
Just clip.

4
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.600
I managed to shame you
before drawing your last breath.

5
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.280
I will inform you that you must
walk around Valhall with the moon wreath.

6
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.400
How does it feel?

7
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.720
Right? I had appreciated
if you were a little more present.

8
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.280
So I could get a bigger reaction.
But okay. Save your energy.

9
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.760
Then you are more present
when I'll kill you afterwards.

10
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.600
It can be smart
to just kill him now.

11
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.480
No. I want him to walk around
with that moon and wreath.

12
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.920
What if he fades away and escapes
while we are busy with the guild?

13
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.640
And come back and seek revenge?

14
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.840
There is no time for worry now. But
it would have been a crisis if he stuck.

15
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.880
But we will fix that later.
Now it's a party.

16
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.120
Now it's a party, guys.

17
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Yes! Then I would like to get
bring out a bowl for my little brother.

18
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.960
Orm! Get up.

19
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.520
Yesterday headed Orm
forces in contention for the first time -

20
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.800
- and convinced big
  on the battlefield.

21
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.360
He managed the piece of art
not at least one man!

22
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.400
You also have to get up, FrÃ¸ya.
You must also be proud of ...

23
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.360
Now I was so ...

24
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.920
Unless Orm deserves the dish of honor,
then no one deserves it! Toast!

25
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.120
Before that, more honors and honors are awarded
to Orm, I would say a few words.

26
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.520
The reason we didn't
lost a single man -

27
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.240
- was that this one
  incompetent army commander -

28
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.400
- took us on a wild goose chase.
  It's the worst I've ever experienced.

29
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.880
It's enough. You have become so
very old, so you just buzz.

30
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.080
Let him talk.

31
00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.480
He guided us in the most cowardly way possible
further and further into the forest, -

32
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.000
- farther and farther away from the battle.
  Intentionally. So we didn't get killed!

33
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.280
But the forest was very capricious.
All the trees were completely identical.

34
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.840
And then we were distracted by a squirrel,
so everything was completely wrong.

35
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.640
It was totally impossible
to do anything.

36
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.920
Then I command
that the dish of honor be withdrawn.

37
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.360
The dish is reversed!
Spit in the horns for Orm.

38
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.560
I am just going to ...

39
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.920
Just air the pee a little ...

40
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.400
Orm?

41
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.160
You are Orm, huh?

42
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.000
That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

43
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.800
You got the gift I sent
to the wedding? Bread board?

44
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.480
I'm not sorry
could be at the wedding.

45
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.560
Yes.

46
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.760
Thanks.

47
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.000
My pleasure.
You deserve a lot more.

48
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.480
Where I come from, we cherish you.

49
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.000
-About me?
-Did you not know?

50
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.160
- Seriously, you're a legend.
-Am I?

51
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.800
-Yes.
-Why?

52
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.440
-Many because of those things.
- What kind of stuff?

53
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:48.440
It's always hard to be specific,
but that's the total package people fell for.

54
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.320
-What is it you have there, then?
-Nothing. Just a few things.

55
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.760
- Come on, see.
-You just think it's stupid.

56
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.000
No I do not.
Let's see.

57
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.840
It's such a royal horse.

58
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.680
It's not finished,
there are no details or anything.

59
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.360
It's very nice.

60
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.880
It looks like a real horse.

61
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.720
It's lifelike.

62
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.520
I know how hard it is,
because I do it myself. A lot.

63
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.920
-No?
-Congle horses and cones ...

64
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.240
Sauer? Artichoke Pigs? Occasionally stock
I have a whole farm with different royal animals.

65
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.720
And then I pioneer.
Then I make small clothes ...

66
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.800
You're not pioneering?
It's totally sick. I pioneer a lot.

67
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.640
-No?
-Yes! We are quite alike, we.

68
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.560
-It is strange.
- Sorry we didn't meet each other before.

69
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.560
-Because I now feel that ...
-What?

70
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.320
-You will laugh ...
-Don't laugh.

71
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.480
... and think this is stupid.
    You are Orm, you have a lot of friends.

72
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.640
No, not fluster, maybe ...

73
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.920
A good, small bunch.

74
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.960
Because I'm not a person like that
throws around me in big words, -

75
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.800
- but I think "best friend" ...

76
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.840
That's right
the expression for the two of us.

77
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.800
-Bestevenn?
-I got a new best friend.

78
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.880
Anyone want some dessert?

79
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.040
Yes. Something sweet is important
after such a powerful meal.

80
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:16.760
Come with me out and see that I am
finally get my revenge.

81
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.880
Come on, Arvid,
do you want something sweet ...

82
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.080
It's a shame that this
the friendship must end tonight.

83
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.160
-Yes.
-Otherwise, we could have had lots of contact.

84
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.000
- Could we?
- Yes, yes. Lots of contact.

85
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.320
Au ...

86
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.680
-What is it?
-It's so painful with those ropes.

87
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.040
- But I can loosen them up.
- No, Orm, it will be too much.

88
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.040
I can't ask you
loosen completely on the ropes behind there.

89
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.560
I insist.
You're not leaving, are you?

90
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.520
We are best friends.
They stick together.

91
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.120
They do not leave
each other only they get the chance.

92
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.400
That's what I've always said.

93
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.640
The reason I asked,
is that I've had friends who run -

94
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.080
- as soon as they got to know me ...

95
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.480
Bear?

96
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.880
He'll be back soon.
In a few steps.

97
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.760
He should probably just ...

98
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.680
(It rattles in something.)

99
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.960
Hello?
Is there anyone here?

100
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.560
I'm just warning you - I'm a warrior!

101
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.400
I'm just coming from flanking!
Come to the light so I can see you.

102
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.840
UAE!

103
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:25.480
That is just one of the reasons
that I will never get married.

104
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.440
- Get dragged into the dirt that way.
-Yes.

105
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.880
People look at you and Orm as a unit.
You will be judged by him.

106
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.960
Fy Loke, then sincerely hope not.

107
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.360
It's just so nice to be free
and jump from one lady to another.

108
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.720
Empty and escape, like.
Thank you, please next.

109
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.720
OK? I have never
sit down with some ladies, then.

110
00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.320
No. But for me it works
more about the possibility of it.

111
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:06.480
The feeling that it could have happened.
If you know what I mean.

112
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.560
Speaking of which, the duty calls.
Got loose on cunt.

113
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.200
You, what do you think about us
take a walk in the back of the longhouse, then?

114
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:52.520
Can I ...
Can I just touch you one more time?

115
00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.440
Yes.

116
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:15.040
- Almost like human skin.
-Yes, it's just a shade darker.

117
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.160
Yeah right.
Human skin, just a little darker.

118
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.640
Nothing to be paralyzed for fear of.
All natural.

119
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.320
Am I seriously the first
colored person you met?

120
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.080
No no no.
Yes. Or maybe.

121
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:40.360
Oh my God. So you lie
far back up here in the quarry.

122
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.000
The others do, not me.

123
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:49.240
Not to brag, though
I've traveled all over the world,

124
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.440
- seen many cultures,
  met emperors and kings.

125
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:58.040
I can even talk
six different languages.

126
00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:03.600
Davs! TjÃ¤nare! Hi! Salaam.
And so on.

127
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.440
I can also "hello".

128
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:11.320
But why are you here
behind lock and turn?

129
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:16.400
-No, because of the skin color, then.
-No!

130
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:22.800
And Jarl Varg does not like otherness.
It's one of his core values.

131
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.200
I'm not like that.
I'm totally color blind like that.

132
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.640
-And then I'm very tolerant.
-Yes.

133
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.680
Where are you from?

134
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:42.680
Therefore ...
Last, before I came here, England.

135
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.120
-England?
-The country that is in the west.

136
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.400
Is it a country in the west?

137
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.760
Are you going to bail me out?
If there is something to do?

138
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.640
I'm the bearer of bad news.
Varg has sentenced you to ...

139
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:28.320
-He sentenced you to death.
Just because I let go of the arch enemy?

140
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.840
-Yes, that too.
- Unfortunately, there will be blood eagles.

141
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.920
Sounds fierce.
Especially when cutting back, -

142
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.640
- and the ribs fold out
  like bird wings ...

143
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.840
It holds galore, FrÃ¸ya.

144
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.800
So we've come to say goodbye.

145
00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:02.640
I notice this is going to be
tearful for all men. And ladies.

146
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.160
-Yes.
-FrÃ¸ya ...

147
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.520
My Beloved ...

148
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.280
My innocence rose.

149
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:18.400
It's sad that it
should end like that. Yes.

150
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.400
I think I'm aiming for a handshake.

151
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.760
Yes, it's more convenient
than the clamps.

152
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.560
-There's so much I should have experienced.
-What?

153
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:45.640
No, I've been told it exists
a country to the west that is so rich -

154
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:51.920
- and full of embellishments
  and arts and culture and pacifists.

155
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.920
I should have gone there
on such a friendly visit.

156
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.880
-A rich country in the west?
-Yes. My cellmate said so.

157
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.640
He has traveled all over Midgard.
He's been there.

158
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.720
Now I became very curious, Orm.

159
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.880
Then I get an idea that is so insane
that it can actually work.

160
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.360
You must beg and pray
about your brother's life?

161
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.400
No, I'm coming
to propose a kind of barter, -

162
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.560
- which will be better
  than a sweaty eagle.

163
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.880
I highly doubt that.
Look at them!

164
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.080
They are hungry for blood.

165
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.800
If I said I could get you
access to a country in the west -

166
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.360
- that is so full
  of wealth and slavery -

167
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.400
- that you can build up again
  your whole army -

168
00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.440
- become the most powerful man in Norway,
  what do you say then?

169
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.520
I'm not saying anything.

170
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.720
I only become immediate
hard as flint - bottom.

171
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.120
I suggest swapping Orm's blood eagle -

172
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:40.400
- against finding this country
  and make a map for you.

173
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:50.240
If I let high treason go unpunished,
creates a deadly precedent.

174
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:56.360
- Prisoners are released in the cabin and weather.
- No, we can't have that.

175
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:05.600
But - I need to save his life
in exchange for that map.

176
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:14.320
But - he needs a symbolic punishment.
It is not to be avoided.

177
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:19.080
He needs a real lesson.

178
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.160
What kind of inventions is this?
A gaping stick for precious parts?

179
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.840
I saved my life for this one
the traitor in exchange for power and wealth!

180
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:46.280
But don't believe in any way
that he will remain unpunished.

181
00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:52.280
Let me have the pleasure of getting
introduce "whip on your purse"!

182
00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:00.720
To show the bullet bag for a large one
the crowd is more than punishment enough.

183
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.120
Go ahead.

184
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.440
-Au!
-Again!

185
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.520
Again! Again! Again!

186
00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.400
- Good luck on the journey, Olav.
Thank you so much.

187
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.920
You lie thin
if this is a joke.

188
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.120
If you come back empty-handed,

189
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.720
- I have a plan to cut Orm
  in tiny little pieces.

190
00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.680
-I wouldn't sacrifice a thought.
- I'm not so sure.

191
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.200
I have the feeling that the map
can cause major problems.

192
00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:01.640
Not at all, Varg.
That map is as good as yours.

193
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.560
Appreciate you saying so,
but something inside me says -

194
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.640
- that map is coming
  creating extremely big problems!

195
00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.120
- For several seasons.
-More seasons?

196
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.200
Yes. Winter, spring, summer and autumn.
There are several seasons.

197
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.760
Good luck on the journey.

198
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.320
Lindisfarne.

199
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:12.360
An insignificant place. An example of one
a place that never ends up in history books.

200
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.800
Rufus Claudianus,
it's not supposed to mess,

201
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.680
- but why can't you act today?
  Hadn't it been something?

202
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:27.920
Have I not said quite clearly that I
going on stage when I feel like it?

203
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.680
It must feel right.
And it doesn't now.

204
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.720
Look around.
Everyone is so chatty and unassuming.

205
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:42.840
They are monks! Maybe they have
made a promise of secrecy or something?

206
00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.960
They do not seem enthusiastic
or knowledgeable either.

207
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.800
That is a minimum requirement.
Rose petals!

208
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.440
Can't you just
play the show?

209
00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:01.840
This is the last stop of the tour.
People want to go home to Rome.

210
00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.720
But I am an artist and do not take
consider your working ant.

211
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.520
The more you mess,
the less correct it feels. Rose petals!

212
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.600
Either way ...

213
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.880
For my feet!
Not in the face.

214
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:23.360
- Anyway, congratulations.
-Thanks. For what?

215
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.960
For stressing me out. I need
a long massage, then we'll see.

216
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.640
Maybe it will be a performance,
maybe not.

217
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.920
Of course.
You are the star after all.

218
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.960
Yes, I am.
Obviously.

219
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.240
New position!

220
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.360
For me, this works
like a key.

221
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:19.520
Yes, a key that unlocks
the creative barriers.

222
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:26.640
I'm actually starting to feel too
to give the people an experience now.

223
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.600
So good. So good.

224
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:42.320
-And they know I'm an inferno?
-Yes. They have been told that.

225
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.880
Oh, that was good.

226
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.720
I hope they are aware
how lucky are they? Oh ...

227
00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.320
I ejaculated! What part of non-
erotic cock massage didn't you understand?

228
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.120
-Sorry!
- This is unheard of!

229
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.000
Find all the seeds! I will have
every drop of my ejaculate!

230
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.920
None of my seeds are going astray
so others can make copies of me!

231
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.800
A scandal! I want to see
you burn that cloth afterwards.

232
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.760
I wonder if I'm walking around, me.

233
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.920
I'm so sorry.

234
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.640
I have given over ten thousand non-erotic
cock massages without ejaculation.

235
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.480
I really do not know
what happened. Sorry.

236
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.920
Hush!

237
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.600
There we have the commitment
I've been waiting for!

238
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.360
Hear how playful they are.

239
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.200
I'm ready.

240
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.560
They have earned themselves
to my performance.

241
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.880
But not right yet.

242
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.600
I'm just waiting a bit.

243
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:38.040
And some more. I incite them, so I do
goes out when the mood is at its peak.

244
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.360
It is an art very few masters.

245
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.920
Being able to enter the scene
at exactly the right time.

246
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
(It's quiet outside.)

247
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.400
Now ...

248
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.840
... it's time.
