1
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.360
Ouch! Ouch! Au ...

2
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.120
-I was just going to cuddle a little.
- You ask for it, then.

3
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.600
-When you touch someone who sleeps.
-Yes. It's noted.

4
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.320
From now on we can have a rule
about waking each other up to snuggle.

5
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.120
I agree with that.
You can snuggle at me at any time.

6
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.440
Now you look tough.
The tattoo ...

7
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.360
Was it as spooky as you hoped for?

8
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.640
I'm fighting.
Jarl Bjørn assembles an army.

9
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.400
-Can you smell it?
-Yes I can.

10
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.480
And my spy says so too.

11
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.040
So we have two sources.

12
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.840
It's going to be a fight, yes.
It does.

13
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.520
-Two sources are good. Good.
-Send a message to our allies.

14
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.760
Send the ravens!

15
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.920
It's a true riddle how
the ravens know exactly where to go.

16
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.920
That's it.
We've come so far technologically -

17
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.640
- that we don't know
  how things work anymore.

18
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.200
Everyone sends the ravens,
but nobody knows how it works.

19
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.400
Think if all the technology
suddenly disappeared?

20
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.160
By then we had been standing on a bare ground.

21
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.920
Almost no one had finished
to make the things we take for granted.

22
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.800
Quiet!
Stop philosophizing!

23
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.440
Funny ...

24
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.560
Do you remember I mentioned that I should
fishing trip with dad and little brother?

25
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.960
After Mom died, it has
gone in one, so a break is nice.

26
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.880
Valuable family time together.

27
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.480
So family time is more important
Than traveling a nest bar?

28
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.000
No, not at all.

29
00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.400
- Was it now this weekend, right?
-Yes, it was the weekend now.

30
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.400
Dad, I'm sorry, though
I have to work! We'll take it again, we!

31
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.760
I love you.

32
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.040
Life!

33
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.120
Come!

34
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.440
-Hi!
-I miss you so crazy.

35
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.720
And I you!
But it's Olvar and me now.

36
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.240
No! Not real. You have
just developed such a syndrome -

37
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.800
- where you tie ties
  to your kidnappers.

38
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.560
-But I'll give you a better life.
-Can you?

39
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.960
Yes. I have relatives in Iceland.
Pack your cases. We're leaving tomorrow.

40
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.240
Life!

41
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.040
Hi!

42
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.280
-You won't believe it!
-What is it?

43
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.120
-I caught an olden drill.
-No? An olden drill?

44
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.000
It is an interesting insect.

45
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.120
You can join and spear it,
if you want. On a stick.

46
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.160
Yes ... There you are, yes.
I just ...

47
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.400
-We are on our way to Vargnes, vi.
-Yes.

48
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.520
-Frøya, you shouldn't go?
-Yes. I'm a shepherd, you know.

49
00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.720
A kind of job journey.
Required.

50
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.440
You haven't said anything about that.
I'll join.

51
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.440
Only boring job stuff ...

52
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.520
It does not matter.
We should do everything together.

53
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.200
- You don't have a horse ...
-I'm sitting with you.

54
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.760
I can massage you, because you are
well stole after all the sexing tonight?

55
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.080
Hey Hey. We got the raven
and come as fast as we could.

56
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.720
Oi!
I like your new style, Varg.

57
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.200
So good.
Thank you.

58
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.480
Great that someone dares to stand out.

59
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.720
-Happy you say that.
-You! Wolf has been given a new style. Spooky.

60
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.680
Is it a nest bar?
Does it work well?

61
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.960
It can summon with magic power
accidents several miles away, so yes.

62
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.800
Totally raw.

63
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:45.560
If Jarl Bjørn attacks from the forest,
then he rides straight into the jets.

64
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.240
Then he's done!
No hope.

65
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:57.080
Don't they ride right into the jets now?
Isn't that good?

66
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.320
Hi! You must turn!
You ride right into the jet!

67
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.120
You get jealous of you!

68
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.440
Oi.
Isn't that Daddy and Trym, then?

69
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.200
Dad ... Dad!
Turn! Fast! Turn!

70
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.960
Get away!
Get away!

71
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.840
Wake up!

72
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.840
- It's just killing them.
- Kill Dad and Trym?

73
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.600
- They are doomed anyway.
-Can we wait to see if nid works?

74
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.040
Nid works.
They are dead men walking.

75
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.440
Yes, of course you are right.

76
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.160
Right in the bulb.
Good, guys.

77
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.760
-Condolences.
-Thanks.

78
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.280
Oh true, what happened here, Varg?
It was violent stuff.

79
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.360
The ones there gave me an oblique look.

80
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.640
And there they were, they thought of me.
I think.

81
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.400
Oh true.

82
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.400
Prefer not to touch the war table.

83
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:11.640
The whole battle plan is on the table, so
it's stupid if you push a figure.

84
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.720
Moving a figure marginally can do
that many hours of work are lost.

85
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.400
It is received. See it.

86
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.080
We have used a lot of resources
on scouting and spying -

87
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.320
- to line up the characters
  exactly as they stand.

88
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.000
Do you enjoy yourself?

89
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.120
You are probably wondering why
I've gathered you here today!

90
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.680
Is it not for gathering the chieftains -

91
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.640
- and plan an attack
  on Jarl Bjorn's army?

92
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:08.480
And to launch a new and revolutionary
concept, the war table?

93
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.040
Where the whole attack is planned
down to every little detail?

94
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.240
That's what you wrote in the notice.

95
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.080
- Did you write all that?
-Yes.

96
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.080
I was clearly on
that it should not be concrete.

97
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.440
Votes. You want to surround yourself
with an aura of mystery.

98
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.560
It was poor call-up crafts.
Sorry about that.

99
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.360
But to answer you:
That's right on a dot.

100
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.120
Jarl Bjørn gathers an army!

101
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.400
My plan is to kill
each one of them.

102
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.280
And Jarl Varg has promised it will
room for lots of offense too.

103
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.440
So it's positive.

104
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.200
Pieces on this side of the table -

105
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.760
- represents forces
  under my command.

106
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.600
This, for example,
are your men.

107
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:34.840
-There you go.
-You attack up this flank.

108
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.200
I'll take that.
Let's see ...

109
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.640
And Olav ... Oi.

110
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.320
Olav ...
I think that's where they stood.

111
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.280
Was not it? I'm pretty
sure of it ... That's it! Think so ...

112
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:11.400
And then Olav, during the attack itself
are you storming up here ...

113
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.960
So, Olav,
from here and up there.

114
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.440
I'll take it ...

115
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.800
May Fenris gnaw
of you all messed up. Out!

116
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.800
- Get out!
- Not you, Olav. Or your right hand.

117
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.520
Torstein! Out. Out!

118
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.600
Frøya, join me,
then we can find some nice yarn.

119
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.120
For pioneering.
Come.

120
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.840
Yes yes ...

121
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.080
Yes ...
Looks like the weather is staying.

122
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.640
It blew a lot yesterday, but it did
seems like the wind has lied a bit.

123
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.680
There are varying winds
from day to day.

124
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.200
It's not equal
wind power every day, no.

125
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.360
Three months of planning
right in the sink.

126
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
strongly, almost.

127
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.400
You have a spectacular face.
So beautiful.

128
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.160
Too bad someone should
come to shame it.

129
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:40.400
Wolf, you ... You must be able to
leaning on a war table, right?

130
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:46.840
Isn't meant to lean
across the table and point out weaknesses -

131
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.720
- and have heated discussions?

132
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.680
Then one comes with one
insane idea that it actually works.

133
00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:03.200
And another feels that he
must follow their heart and cry out:

134
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:10.440
"You have my sword!" Everyone votes in,
 and then they speak with one voice.

135
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:17.560
Everyone has a common goal to fight for.
That's how I've seen it for myself.

136
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:23.560
I hate to say it, but you're right!
That is exactly what I saw!

137
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.120
And you saw how wrong
the center of gravity was in those pieces.

138
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.080
An accident waiting to happen.

139
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.000
Arvid did not overturn the table -
it was simply a craft.

140
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.120
You are right. Very right.

141
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.360
Oi. Whoa.

142
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.440
Is it a little raven with a message?

143
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.520
Look here, then. Is that an important one
message you got there, little raven?

144
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.040
It's a hen, that one.

145
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.280
Hen. Of course.
I'm not very good at birds.

146
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.560
Beak and wings, yes,
otherwise they are the same.

147
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:25.440
- Don't see the difference between sparrows and eagles?
-Don't feel. Completely poultry blind.

148
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:31.520
But maybe the scouts are empty
for ravens and sent a letter hen?

149
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.920
If it's a hen and not a raven.
I can only trust you.

150
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.480
Should you check that message, right?
Maybe it is seriously important.

151
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.520
A poultry came with this.

152
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.040
Our hour has finally arrived.

153
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.200
Jarl Bjorn's army
marching towards Vargnes.

154
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.560
-Go home and gather your troops, Olav!
-Will do.

155
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.080
And the warbeater
must get his punishment!

156
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.720
- Maybe hammer his hammer?
-No.

157
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.800
He should be stripped for limbs.
Left arm. Right leg.

158
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.360
His tongue and dick!

159
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.520
Seen on the battlefield.
This will be good!

160
00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.040
Hi, Olvar.
There you were, yes.

161
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.920
-What are you doing?
-I gather my things together.

162
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.320
And why?
-No special reason.

163
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:16.840
I like to have my things together.
Preferably in a bag or practical bag.

164
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.520
-And you ... Are you going somewhere?
-Yes actually.

165
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.840
I'm going out and meeting some girlfriends.

166
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:32.240
-Who?
-I prefer not to mention names.

167
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.000
No one mentioned,
nobody forgot, in a way.

168
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.520
OK.

169
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.160
One thing before you go.

170
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:52.280
I feel
that you have been a little disappointed -

171
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:58.640
- for not having sued you
  with jewelry and clothes and stuff.

172
00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.760
A little, maybe. Nothing ...

173
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.080
It's been a test.

174
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.360
I just wanted to make sure
that you married me -

175
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.520
- for all the right reasons.

176
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:21.240
That you weren't the only one
sought status and material goods.

177
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.120
What?
Did you think that about me?

178
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:33.560
So ... I was wondering about that
was true love on your part.

179
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.080
- Now you disappoint me, Olvar.
-Yes.

180
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.880
I'm feeling rotten now.

181
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.480
And for good reason.
Since you were so wrong.

182
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.520
Yes ...
But from now on, there will be other bowls.

183
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:59.880
Well I really should
surprise you with status symbols -

184
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:06.360
- so you can really rise
  over the other women in Norheim.

185
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:13.240
-Here you got some shopping for.
-It is fantastic! I'm overwhelmed.

186
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.160
Yes ...

187
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:22.000
You really deserve it
your amazing class trip.

188
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.040
-Can I wear the rings now?
-Yes.

189
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.320
- They are yours ...
-And there's more where they come from?

190
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:34.960
A lot. I'm not called the richest
the farmer in Norheim for nothing.

191
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.720
Now this relationship begins
to look like something, Olvar.

192
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.800
That's how it is when you love
each other over everything on earth, you know.

193
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.240
But now you must go.
See you later.

194
00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.560
It sat well, that cock
until he the warlord ...

195
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.920
Look here, then. Now we have none
waterproof plan anymore either.

196
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.760
No need to worry.

197
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.560
I've saved a secret plan
for the right occasion.

198
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.120
And this is the right occasion.

199
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.480
- Battle of Jarl Bjørn?
-Votes!

200
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:31.440
And if we succeed, we will
not to lose a single man.

201
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.960
Find out the march boots.
We leave at dawn.

202
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.000
Varg? Varg!

203
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.520
I wonder if we got it wrong.

204
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.280
Oh no.

205
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.600
-That's not a good idea.
-Why not?

206
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.720
Isn't this the Dragon Valley, then?

207
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.280
The name comes from that
lives a spooky dragon in the area.

208
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:24.160
That is exactly why we are here.
And we get that feature on our team, -

209
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.480
- then we become invincible.

210
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.800
That's my secret plan!

211
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.240
Hello?
Is anybody home?

212
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:54.560
-Dragerytteren.
-We haven't met. Torstein Dog.

213
00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:01.200
You have some nerves to come
to the Dragedalen. If you can say that.

214
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.760
-What do you want?
-It's brewing up for war.

215
00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:10.640
We would love to use your dragon
to fire from Jarl Bjørn's army.

216
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.080
I don't use the dragon in war.
That's a principle.

217
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.680
That would be cowardly,
since it is so superior.

218
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.760
Of course.
I understand that.

219
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:30.160
But you might still think we do
could take a little look at the dragon?

220
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.600
So, I should like
invited you in, -

221
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.120
- but I haven't
  enabled visits.

222
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.480
We don't care.
We are not ...

223
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:59.240
I almost think I have to insist
to see the dragon now that we are here.

224
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.360
Yes ...

225
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.560
She sleeps.
A really deep sleep.

226
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.000
-Don't we see it when it's asleep?
-No.

227
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.640
If she wakes up
with strangers present -

228
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:23.600
- then it can occur
  a really confusing situation.

229
00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.880
Fascinating.

230
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.640
There I sit on my back to the dragon.

231
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.240
And there she sparks fire.

232
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:43.080
And here you see the scale of the dragon.
That mountain is called Kjempefjellet.

233
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:49.200
Oh! See Giant Mountain looks small by
side of! Then we talk big dragon.

234
00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.560
Yes.

235
00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:57.760
I don't quite get the size ratio
to vote here.

236
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:05.040
Here you sit on the back of the dragon.
A little big horse.

237
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.800
While here is the dragon
the size of a mountain?

238
00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:14.640
Sure, but it has
a natural explanation.

239
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.960
There she was just a puppy,
while there she is fully grown.

240
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:31.360
- What's that?
-Look I command the dragon.

241
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.320
Very exciting.

242
00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.520
Do we have time for a little
thought experiment?

243
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.760
-Yes.
-For example, totally hypothetical, -

244
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:50.960
- if I took the dagger and drove it
  right in your stomach, pulled it out -

245
00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.160
- and took the nap from you, -

246
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.920
- is it so then the dragon
  would have been under my command?

247
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.960
That's a very good question.
And the answer is no.

248
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:11.520
The handset is mostly a prop.
To create a total package, like.

249
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.320
We have a close bond.
The dragon just listens to me.

250
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.440
Can I please borrow
your dragon? I need it.

251
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.560
No.
Principles are principles.

252
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.920
What do you say to get rich?

253
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.400
Incredibly rich?

254
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.840
I really have
swore an oath to myself.

255
00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:44.920
About never profiting on the dragon.
So unfortunately:A no is a no.

256
00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.880
It was a shame, after all.

257
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.640
Life? Beloved!

258
00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.760
Now it is
straight road to Iceland. Come.

259
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.720
-Don't make it difficult now.
-What then, difficult?

260
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.440
I've gone
many rounds with myself.

261
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.640
But I have to listen to my inner voice.

262
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.680
- What does it say?
- That I can't go.

263
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.160
Olvar has been convinced lately.
He has stepped up the game.

264
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.560
- Did he give you jewelry?
- That's not the reason.

265
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:37.480
It was more about the inner voice
said when I got the jewelry.

266
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.960
Oh yes.

267
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.680
- Time to go, buddy.
-What happens now?

268
00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.280
Are you serious?
Should he join?

269
00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:00.720
Good luck, Arnstein.
You have new adventures ahead of you now.

270
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:07.120
And I can't stress it enough:
I never meant to hurt you.

271
00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:20.280
Make sure they get a good owner
in the new place, then, Sturla!

272
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.720
It was an incredible shame, that is.

273
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.800
I was looking forward to it
to have a dragon on the team.

274
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.920
It's just that crisis!

275
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.480
Wait! I changed my mind, me.
I'm doing it.

276
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.720
Because of the money. I can
well imagine me being incredibly rich.

277
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.600
Excellent.

278
00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.800
It is not
to become rich that is the goal -

279
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.080
- but to let go
  to worry about money.

280
00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.160
-Right?
-A wise man once said:

281
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:12.000
Money is not everything
as long as you have enough of them.

282
00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.960
Then we have a deal.

283
00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:27.200
I already know
the smell of burnt human flesh -

284
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.960
- and hear the sound
  of desperate screams of pain.
