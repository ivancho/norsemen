WEBVTT

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.240
Yes, we'll soon be back in Norheim, folks.
Let's have a cheer for that!

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.880
[all] Hooray!

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.840
First of all, I have to say that I feel
we've developed a very special bond.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.880
All of us here. Together.
So, uh...

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.200
That's quite nice, isn't it, folks?

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.640
Some of you may have noticed that
we sailed towards the West this time.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.280
And Jarl Varg,
he doesn't need to find that out.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.680
So if anyone asks,
just say East, OK?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.080
Excuse me.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.480
You mean lie?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.760
Because it's really stressful
to be caught in a web of lies.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.840
Yes.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.360
Sure, but...

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.800
Does anyone here know
what a blood eagle is?

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.800
A blood eagle is when
your spine column is exposed

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.440
and your ribs are severed
from the spine and pulled out

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.280
to resemble wings.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.680
And then your lungs
are pulled out of your body.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.800
So anyone who says anything to anyone
about traveling to the West,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.120
gets a blood eagle.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.120
Just so you know it.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.800
Is it OK if I tell my brother?
In strict confidence, of course.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.960
-No you can't tell your brother.
-Could I tell my cousin?

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.040
If he promises not to say anything?
He's really good at keeping secrets.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.480
No, you can't tell your cousin,
either. Any other questions?

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.320
Ship! 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.600
There's the ship! 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.280
Ship! 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.920
They're coming! 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.800
Look at you!
Are you trying out some new costume?

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.560
You're shaking.
Is everything OK?

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.800
Everything is OK.
Everything is according to plan.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.400
Look at this.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.960
Treasures.
Gold.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.880
Coins.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.440
I've led the most successful raid
in the history of this village.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520
That's not bad.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.480
I made it pretty clear

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.400
that we needed metal
to complete the installation.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.000
Haven't you...
couldn't you steal any metal?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.360
There's some silver cups and some cutlery.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.360
But no metal.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.200
Metal, metal, metal.
Where can I find lots of metal?

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.400
Good folks, as you all may know,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.440
this was our very, very last raid.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.800
We're now going to become
a cultural capital.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.120
But in order to make that happen,
I order each of all of you

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.280
to place your swords, and your helmets

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.480
and your chainmails and your
axes in that carriage over here.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.520
This is the Viking Age. Armed conflict
is kind of part of the game here.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.480
What if someone attacks us?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.520
Your reactionary attitude
is hilarious, Arvid.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.880
Who in their right mind would attack
a village that is organizing

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.800
the country's best
and only summer play?

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.320
-And building an installation?
-Come on, Arvid!

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.440
So into the carriage with the weapons.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.640
All the weapons
are being melted into art.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.960
Good, good.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.200
Not so hard.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.080
Thank you.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.480
Very well.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.920
-This is good!
-One ax, one sword, makes art.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.400
Now we're talking!

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.880
[cup rattling]

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.400
Allow me to propose a first toast.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.160
To the most successful raid ever.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.040
And to Rufus, who has done
a phenomenal job while we were gone.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.960
-Sk책l!
-Sk책l!

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.360
So, are you also excited

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.480
about the installation and the play?

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.720
Yeah.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.720
I'm sure it will be a real upgrade.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.040
Mm-hm.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.680
It's crazy.
We have no weapons.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.440
-We've never been so unsafe.
-You should be the chieftain, you know.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.240
Orm is totally useless,
especially as a chieftain.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.840
Are we having fun?

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.480
What are we talking about?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.720
Nothing special. We were
just reminiscing about the raid

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.760
and all that.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.160
-Really? That's all?
-Yeah.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.960
Strange.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.000
I thought I heard you mention me.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.480
-No way. We weren't talking about you.
-No?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.080
So how are things going
with the disarmament?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.360
We have collected everything
and delivered to the blacksmith.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.040
Good. Good.
Well done. Well done.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.120
No, no, no.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.240
I know a man's perineum
is forbidden fruit,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.200
but that's what makes it
so exciting!

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.400
Well, if it isn't Jarl Varg's men!

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.000
Welcome.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.760
Welcome to my humble abode.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.760
As I call it.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.120
Don't just stand there. Get some mead
and meat for our honorable guests.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.640
What's the occasion for this feast?

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.000
I don't think it's a feast.
It's more like a gathering.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.960
We're celebrating our return
from the lands to the... East.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.560
With an extremely meager bounty.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.040
I see.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.360
Yeah. I presume you have
Jarl Varg's share ready?

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.880
Yes, yes.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.360
-I see you've got some new slaves?
-Yes.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.120
Do you mind if I take a look myself?

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.880
No.
Sure.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.720
I wouldn't have it any other way.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.160
Look at this.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.160
Is there a new type of slave out East?

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.040
-No.
-Aren't they more square-faced?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.760
With narrow eyes
and hooked noses?

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.520
No, that was before.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.200
I see.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.360
You can see for yourself.
They are extremely Eastern people.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.120
Almost Chinaman.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.680
They're not Chinaman.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.440
-The jury's still out on that.
-No, they're not.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.000
We are from the West.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.640
They stole us from Britain.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.920
Over the sea to the West.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.720
East, East.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.520
Blah, blah, blah...

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.080
East.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.560
These guys have red hair and talk
a language I've never heard before.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.640
There are so many different languages.
You never know what a slave speaks.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.400
What does a slave speak?
Slavonian? Or Slavish?

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.640
Slavegian?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.720
Slavish, perhaps?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.160
Don't bore yourself with these slaves.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.760
Have a sip of our local mead.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.720
Mead isn't just mead anymore.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.000
-No, you're right.
-There are a lot of different types.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.680
No, I agree.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.960
-It's complex. Full-bodied.
-Yes.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.720
It's tasteful. Yes.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.520
-Well-balanced.
-Yes.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.800
With a...

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.920
A hint of smoke

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.240
in the aroma, the flavor.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.600
Yes, all of that.
Let's just enjoy ourselves, now.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.120
And not worry about
whether someone went on a raid

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.000
in this direction or that.
All that's very boring.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.880
Cheers! Sk책l! 

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.240
Sk책l! 

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.600
[shouting and chanting]

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.120
So sure you're sober enough to ride?

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.480
Yes, I'm sure.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.840
Give Jarl Varg my very, very best.
You know, big hugs.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.200
I'm sorry his share wasn't bigger,
but you know how it is... out East.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.000
Take care!

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.360
I almost forgot one thing. I'd like
to bring one of the ginger people.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.320
They look like a bit of fun.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.160
I hope the Jarl won't find out
where that slave really came from.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.840
-How would he figure that out?
-I don't know.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.960
By someone understanding
the language he speaks for example?

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.000
That's not going to happen, is it?

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.360
One can only hope.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.840
No, no, no, that won't happen.
It's just a matter of positive thinking.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.960
Nine out of ten concerns
are completely unfounded.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.720
Isn't that what they say?

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.720
-I don't know...
-No, that's what they say.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.560
Who says that?

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.640
Nine out of ten concerns
are unfounded.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.760
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.880
But, who says that?

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.960
No, I don't know who says it,
I haven't got names.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.440
People.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.440
People do.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.440
-I've never heard that.
-No, it's true.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.480
Please!

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.400
Please, Jarl Varg!

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.280
Everything is OK.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.040
Relax.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.160
Relax.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.560
Great.
Open your mouth.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.600
Yes?

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.280
Jarl Varg?

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.160
Our assumption was right.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.560
The Norheim villagers
have been on a raid.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.800
Something tells me our share
was somewhat meager?

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.240
Well, Orm isn't trustworthy, so it's

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.000
hard to say, but this is our share.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.840
Wow. Buttons.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.040
They're just to fill it up a bit.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.560
They got some pretty
exotic slaves, too.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.240
Gingers.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.560
Look at his teeth.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.200
Very nice teeth.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.560
His hair is red as fire.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.760
And he's got spots

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.720
on his face.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.400
How odd.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.560
Carrot head.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.680
Lord in heaven, blessed are thy name.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:49.000
Forgive us of our sins, as we
forgive those who sin against us.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.040
-You understand what he says?
-Sure.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.640
Ask him where he's from.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.640
Where are you from?

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.000
England.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.800
He's from England.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.960
It's a land to the West.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.960
Norheim will be crushed.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.440
By Thor, I'm so excited.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.920
There something about a man
that wants something,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.440
no matter how silly it may seem,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.120
that does something to me.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.480
Sorry.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.120
My dear, loyal subjects.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.000
The day has arrived.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.960
And this is not only the unveiling
of an installation.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.160
But this is the unveiling

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.080
of a new era!

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.400
Now you're allowed to cheer.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.200
[half-hearted cheering]

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.440
As I'm just as excited as you are.
I give to you...

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.000
The installation!

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.120
What is it?

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.800
Some kind of big weapon?

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.240
Weapon? No, no, no this is art.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.040
And art may be the most
powerful of all weapons.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.240
If you think about it.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.000
-So it is a weapon.
-No, no, not exactly.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.680
Then how are we going to win battles?

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.200
With our... emotions.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.360
-So what do you think?
-It stinks!

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.240
This is good.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.040
It seems like I've triggered some
emotions here and that's perfect.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.360
Because art is supposed to
provoke and challenge.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.440
Create debate. Disgust.
We have to dare to debate.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.520
But not come to the point
where we suppress

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.000
and censor based
on individual taste.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.240
-Yes?
-I just think everyone here

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.720
is having trouble understanding
what the point

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.560
behind this installation
is supposed to be.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.160
Well.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.240
The installation is a very important

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.960
focal point.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.320
And it shows...

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.920
-It shows cultural strength.
-And puts us on the map.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.680
And that is very important. And...

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.640
Anyway.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.720
It's an artist's privilege
not having to explain his art.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.320
And tomorrow rehearsals will begin
for the summer play.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.240
So those of you participating,
make sure to get a good night's sleep.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.960
So you can deliver 100% on stage.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.960
Move.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.600
Move, assholes.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.720
-Orm...
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.360
Jarl Varg?

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.440
-I'm back from Norheim.
-Yes?

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.960
It seems like they have
completely lost their focus,

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.000
or are focusing on something
that didn't make sense to me.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.120
-There wasn't one guard in sight.
-Perfect. What are we waiting for?

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.680
This will be like stealing raisins
from a baby.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.480
[crunch and moaning]

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.480
Rotten.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.880
A rotten tooth. A rotten tooth.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.200
Rotten tooth.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.000
Arvid?

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.120
Are you still sleeping?
Today is the big day!

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.520
Look what Orm has sent you,
costumes for today's rehearsals.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.160
This is gonna be so magical.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.520
-What?
-Unwrap it.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.480
Don't just lay there like a dork.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.920
-What's this?
-"What's this"?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.760
Just because it isn't an ax or a sword,
you have to ask "what's this"?

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.480
I can see what it is but
why did I get it?

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.960
Because you have been hand-picked
for a role in the play. What an honor!

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.360
To be honest, I have to say,
I'm a bit surprised they believe in you.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.720
They must see something
no one else sees.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.080
Loki!

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.080
OK, folks. We're finally ready
to start rehearsing.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.720
So if everyone works together, 

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.520
I guarantee you we'll put Norheim
on the theater map.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.040
Of course, Chieftain Orm has the lead.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.760
As the prince's mother.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.240
Arvid will play
the prince's sister, Othella.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.120
And Kark is their maid servant.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.600
OK, let's hear it for them, folks!

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.360
[half-hearted cheer]

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.240
OK.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.160
Oh, knights of the West!

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.640
What do you want from us?

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.560
We are but simple farm girls
lost in the castle.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.840
Spare our lives, for we are virgins.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.360
-Yes, to that we swear.
-We can all swear.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.840
Line.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.880
-Spare our lives, for we are virgins?
-Your next line!

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.120
Arvid, the least you can do is focus.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.880
Jesus!

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.520
Damn.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.360
Fuck!

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.640
Sabotaging this is absolutely
uncalled for, Arvid.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.520
Just look at Orm.
He's never acted before.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.440
But he's practically
blowing me away here!

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.720
And Kark?
Exceptional!

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.640
So expressive,
in both movement and delivery.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.320
Thank you. That's the first time
anyone's ever given me a compliment.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.440
If a retard like Kark
can manage to act,

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.280
surely you can too?

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.720
You actually frighten me with
your lack of intellectual capacity here.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.800
-And you're ugly.
-Huh?

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.600
What?

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.480
I'm not saying that to be mean but
it's important to vent all the crap

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.480
if we're going to work
this close together.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.200
From the top.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.240
Oh, knights of the West!

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.880
What are they doing?

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.120
All I see are three gorgeous
women showing off.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.240
I really got this
Sodom and Gomorrah vibe here.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.120
It's really important

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.120
that these ladies don't distract us.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.920
We are here to find Orm.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.920
And when we do,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.720
we'll carve him
into tiny, tiny pieces.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.440
That's why I brought
this tiny, tiny knife.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.480
You have to defend yourselves.
Raise your arms like this.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.520
You're under attack,
for Christ's sake!

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.880
[thud]

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.840
We're under attack!

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.520
[shouting]

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.800
Well, that's a tad too much.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.840
Odin, my creator!
Jarl Varg in the flesh!

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.720
So powerful.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.200
Now that's a real man for you.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.000
Hm.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.000
Sure brought my little acorn to life.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.040
I just got a clit-boner.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.360
Women to the great hall.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.720
Men in the cage.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.400
I hope you're satisfied with yourself,

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.840
now that we've become
a cultural capital and all.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:39.080
Not a single weapon to be found.
Excellent plan. Great job.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.200
This is not the time to dwell
on our differences.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.880
You have to save me, Arvid!

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.920
There's something about protecting your
chieftain that is extremely important.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.160
Where is that miserable Chieftain Orm?

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.360
Next on the agenda:

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.400
Defiling!

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.680
But where to start?

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.080
Let's see.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Nice and firm.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.000
By Thor!

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.280
No wonder the women of Norheim

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.480
are of such high repute.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.320
Help!
Help!

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.240
Save me! Save me!
Help!

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.200
Mercy!

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.760
Where is Orm?

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.640
Clever.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.680
That old pretend-to-whisper-
and-suddenly-spit-in-the-face trick.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.080
Very good.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.400
We have to get out of here
before they defile us to death.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.200
So here's the plan.
You go to the guard by the door

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.240
And distract him. Then I'll sneak
up on him from behind and kill him.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.880
And then we just run out, charge the
others and hope for the best.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.360
Good plan.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.040
We could of course use the
potty hatch, but you're the Viking.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.520
What's the potty hatch?

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.040
It's a hatch that leads directly
into the woods. But you wanted...

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.640
-No, no, no, no! Potty hatch.
-Potty hatch.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.560
Come on!
Come on! 

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.160
Yes!
Come on! 

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.880
What about Orm?
He's really getting pounded in there.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.080
Come on!
Yes! Yes! 

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.840
Anyone else want
to sacrifice something for Orm?

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.720
-A finger, maybe?
-No, no.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.800
I won't sacrifice a damn shit
for that guy.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.200
Orm is in the guild hall

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.240
in a turquoise dress.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.880
Come on!
Yes, yes, yes!

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.320
Fuck, yeah!

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.080
Come on!

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.600
Yes, come on...
Come on, we have to go.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.960
But we have to get
the Map to the West.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.120
No, I'll get it.
You don't have to worry about that.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.200
You don't have to worry about that.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.360
-I'm right here.
-That's a very private chest.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.120
No, that's not the map.
Put that down again.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.400
What is it?

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.600
Don't look at it.
I don't know what it is. It's...

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.920
Someone left it there.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.440
It's a tent peg.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.240
Is there some sort of law
against having tent pegs?

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.120
Here it is!

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.000
Just put it in the sack
and I'll take care of it.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.320
That's probably the safest.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.120
I'll take it!
