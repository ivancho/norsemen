WEBVTT

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.160
I know it's one of you.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.280
The hard part
is that he looks like a woman.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.000
He's very feminine.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.480
Such a disagreeable

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.040
character.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.920
Oh!
Look what we have here.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.880
Orm.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.560
-No!
-Orm, Orm, Orm.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.680
Such a great master of

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.480
disguise.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.320
But you can't hide your nut sack
with makeup and a costume.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.040
[gasps]

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.960
Jarl Varg?

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.520
We found a secret exit.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.760
Orm has escaped.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.200
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.040
What is it?

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.800
-What is it?
-I have a stitch.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.080
-A stitch?
-I can't be sure.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.760
Okay, we haven't exactly gotten
very far from the village.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.840
Maybe we should...

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.760
The stitch is eating me up inside.
I can't walk a step more.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.160
-You can do that.
-No.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.960
A stitch isn't that painful!

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.360
I'm known far and wide for my
extremely high pain threshold.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.480
Are you?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.160
But this hurts. They say that stitches
are more painful than childbirth.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.960
So we're staying here.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.680
If there is one person I never thought
would manage to escape, it's Orm.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.960
He can't have gone far.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.880
Just one thing.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.080
What happened down there...

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.520
If you think I was involved in
some sort of homosexual activity,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.880
you couldn't be more wrong.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.160
Passionate sex with another man?
Doesn't get more gay than that, does it?

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.560
Sure, but what's important
is that according to Viking law,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.160
you haven't engaged in
illegal homosexual activity

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.520
as long as you are the active part.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.800
-Really?
-Yes. That's why I was so active

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.920
with fingers and tongue
and hip thrusts and all those things.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.360
It was a real dance of life,
wasn't it?

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.520
It was. And what's important
is that Viking law

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600
is extremely clear on that issue.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.560
As long as you are the active part

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.520
in an homosexual activity,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.720
it's not illegal
and... no honor is lost.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.480
-So you haven't lost any honor?
-No, no. Not at all.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.400
On the contrary.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.800
Orm!

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.760
I know you pillaged to the West!

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.760
All I need is the map! 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.560
Give me the map
and I'll save your life, Orm!

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.760
Everyone else though will be slaves.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.240
But you are safe.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.200
Orm! 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.000
No one would agree
to a deal like that.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.200
My gods, does he really believe
you're that much of a coward?

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.640
Orm?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.480
Orm!

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.480
Orm!

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.120
-Orm!
-I'm here!

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.040
Here I am!
Here!

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.480
I didn't really run away.
I...

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.240
Orm, Orm, Orm.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.200
-I hope you have what I want.
-Coward!

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.000
Like you wouldn't have done
the same thing!

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.480
No one here would have
sacrificed the village!

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.000
That's easy for you to say,
being all safe in a cage.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.120
Here it is. I meant to give it to you
all along, so this feels good.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.640
Orm...

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.280
Orm, Orm, Orm.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
What is this, Orm?

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.600
A lot of large penises and rectums?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.960
This is not a map.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.200
Maybe it is a map.
Maybe it's a map of the body.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.800
Check it out!

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.440
I hope you are ready, Orm.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.360
Blood eagles
are very fashionable these days.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.600
No! Don't, don't, don't!

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.640
I know exactly where the map is.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.640
Arvid. Arvid has it.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.400
-Arvid?
-Yes.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.000
That retarded right-hand man to Olav?

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.160
Maybe I was
the right-hand man for Olav.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.080
But he was the brains
behind the raid to the West,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.600
and he hid the map and
everything!

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.320
OK.
Let's find Arvid and slice him up.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.840
No, you won't find him.
You have to use cunning.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.960
Just forget this blood-eagle
stuff and let me go!

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.760
I know his weakness.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.160
Excuse me.
Is there a Liv here?

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.760
-Liv?
-Yeah, that's me.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.960
You are to be defiled.
In public.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.400
Huh?
Defiled?

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.320
Yeah.
You know...

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.200
Raped. In public.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.680
So, I'm sorry. It was not my idea
at all. But you know...

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.680
It's part of the deal here.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.600
By the Earl, then?
Does he do those things himself?

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.960
Yeah, it's...
You know.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.560
I can't totally guarantee it,
but let's cross our fingers and hope

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.280
that the Earl
will do the defiling today.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.400
So, come on.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.400
-Yes.
-Be strong!

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.560
It's just outside the door here.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.840
Can you close the door after me?
You can go first.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.680
Arvid!

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.240
I want the map!

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.840
No honorable man
would let his woman

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.120
be penetrated in public!

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.600
What a douche!

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.760
Come on, Arvid!

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.760
This is not very honorable.
Honor is important.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.120
So I have to do something, don't I?

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.880
You can't attack them
with only a knife.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.400
I don't see that being
the right strategic choice.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.800
Magnus, rape Arvid's wife.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.760
Him? A mere foot soldier?

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.280
-Ridiculous!
-Rape her.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.120
You know, it's kind of funny, but...

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.280
Any other day, I would have just
jumped on her and pounded away.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.480
Yes.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.680
But there's been so much lately,
with this invasion of Norheim

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.000
and the long horse ride here and all...

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.200
I just don't feel

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.760
fresh.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.600
Håkon?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.280
Rape her.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.600
Yeah, the thing is, I'm just not that

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.880
comfortable doing this.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.000
If my wife back home finds out

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.640
that I'm raping people on my business
trips, she's really gonna lose it.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.720
OK. Incredible, incredible.
I have to do everything myself.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.160
Raped by an Earl.
Now we're talking!

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.400
Finally. I can't wait
to get pumped full of power.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.560
-Quiet, please.
-Sorry. Just got a little excited.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.040
For a victim, she sure is bold.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.120
Could I get a pillow?
Because you'd get a better angle,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.160
and your seed will easier
find its way up my birth canal.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.280
No pillow.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.880
Obviously she's not thinking clearly.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.000
Turn your backs.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.280
That goes for you as well in the cage!

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.920
I don't need hundreds of eyes
staring at my butt

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.960
while I'm pumping the granny
out of her!

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.000
Come on. You can do this, boy.
She's afraid. Remember that.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.160
You are powerful.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.160
Arvid?

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.240
This is the last warning, Arvid.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.880
I'm about to penetrate your wife!

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.560
And soon we will become
Eskimo brothers.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.720
Are you ready?

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.200
-I guess I should attack.
-I may have an idea.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.160
I think I know someone
who can help us.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.480
You stay out of this, Arvid! I have the
chance to have powerful Earl seed now!

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.400
You said you had an idea?

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.120
This is the jackpot, you hear me?
The jackpot!

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.000
No erection.
Yes, great.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.400
I think we'll draw the line there.
You were lucky this time, Arvid!

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.440
This was just a warning.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.400
Under other circumstances,
with sun and happy people,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.040
I would have drowned her
with my great, wonderful Jarl-sperm!

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.120
So...

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.640
Hm.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.960
Get out of my way.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.880
There's your army.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.920
Eirik?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.880
Uncle Oddvar?

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.400
Hey, Arvid!

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.800
-But you're all dead.
-No, we're alive.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.080
In some sort of limbo, then?

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
Not quite Valhalla,

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.440
because you have some unfinished
business here on earth?

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.600
Well, we were supposed
to do the ættestup.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.600
But it kind of goes against
all human instinct

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.000
to throw yourself off a cliff
to your certain death like that.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.400
It's so... lemming.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.520
Mm.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.920
So what you're saying is that you're
some sort of Army of the Dead?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.760
Under my command.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.880
No, that's not what I'm saying.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.600
I think I need to sit down and try
to figure out what's happening here.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.560
Now I think I know what
that misunderstanding was about.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.040
-You're alive!
-Yes.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.320
But you're still willing
to fight for me, right?

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.400
Of course!

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.960
That's what we've
been trying to tell you.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.760
Falling in battle is the only way
for us to get to Valhalla.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.880
So this is really what you
can call an ideal situation.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.160
Sounds good to me.
Let's make a plan!

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.160
I've struggled with the blood supply
to the nether regions myself.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.880
From time to time.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.000
Especially with the wife.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.800
Other times it's hard as a pebble.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.000
The meat whistle likes to dance to its
own tune. Isn't that what they say?

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.200
Anyway, you can comfort yourself
that the West is overrated.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.240
We have something
that's far more valuable.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.200
-Diamonds?
-No, no.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.280
More than that.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.400
Rubies?

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.120
Theater!

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.120
Theater?

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.560
If I just can get a few key individuals
out of that cage,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.200
we can show you an excerpt
from this summer's play.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.960
Shame!

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.600
She loves thee!

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.480
No, she loves thee!

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.040
[shouting continues]

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.160
Again, it's very difficult to imagine

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.280
without all the props and all the...

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:14.600
And we didn't have a chance to warm
up, so we didn't reach the high notes.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.360
Maybe we can try again?

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.480
I never felt this before.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.520
Can we just do it again?
Maybe now that we're warmed up.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.720
I have some kind of

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.040
liquid

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.880
out of my eye.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.960
Most of all,

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.120
I think I learned
something about myself.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.800
And the society we live in.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.480
[horn blows]

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.400
[horn blows]

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.080
Ah.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.160
Here comes the pig
to the slaughterhouse.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.720
That many?

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.640
I thought you said he was alone.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.560
He was, the last time I saw him.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.680
And all the Vikings are down
there in the cage.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.600
So Loki knows who those guys are.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.400
[shouting]

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.720
Varg!

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.320
[sniff]

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.000
OK, fatso.
Send me to Valhalla.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.960
First of all,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.720
I'm not fat.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.040
I have a curved spine.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.640
So my stomach
tends to bulge out a little.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.720
Because my spine turns inwards,
in a sense.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.360
And second of all...

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:33.400
I'm going to spare your life. Because
I understand you have been fooled here.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.480
Yeah.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.040
Yes. The wisest man resigns.
Isn't that what they say, Arvid?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.800
You truly are big-hearted.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.200
Seriously, showing that you're willing
to put conflicts behind you quickly,

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.840
and not dwell on what stupid
things others may have done.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.360
I give you my respect.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.280
Thanks.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.040
You're quite a man.
Your chieftain is very, very proud of you.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.880
So, yes...

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.080
I guess I'll take over from here.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.760
It's very important not to have
any doubt as to who actually is

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.120
the leader of Norheim.
No one would benefit from that.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.880
Arvid, Arvid...

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.120
Arvid!

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.720
I don't think that's gonna work.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.360
I mean, you're welcome to try.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.200
-But I don't think it's gonna work.
-You're probably right.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.560
But I'm so tactile!

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.800
Arvid!

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.000
Arvid...

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.040
Hi.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.640
Chieftain Arvid.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.000
Who would have dreamt that?

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.080
I dreamt about it.
And Olav dreamt about it.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.480
Can I ask you something?

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.800
Mm-hm.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.480
Do you think it is OK if a person
has one weakness,

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.520
or does everybody
have to be completely perfect?

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.840
You can't exactly expect anyone
to be perfect all the time.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.400
Because I have one tiny weakness.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.120
I love power.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.200
I'm drawn to power like a moth
to a flame. That's just who I am, Arvid.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.880
I'm aware of that.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.400
Olvar, he was so rich.
And you were so strong.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.960
And Jarl Varg...
Well, he was an Earl.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.800
Actually I don't understand
why every woman in town

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.560
didn't throw
themselves at him?

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.560
Because he's a psychopath
and very very evil?

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.720
No, that felt more like
a role he was playing.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.720
You can't judge him based on that.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.640
Even a guy that bad,
you were attracted to?

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.480
Yeah, but nothing happened anyway.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.440
I just hope you can forgive me.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.720
Yeah, I guess I can.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.400
You can?

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.360
I just want to start
with a clean rune stick, now.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.760
Sure, we can do that.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.840
-Hi there, Kark.
-Greetings, Chieftain Arvid!

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.600
You have any space left in your sty?
You have a new roommate.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.960
Yeah, of course.
Where there's a sty, there's a way.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.560
-You're kidding now, Arvid!
-I'm serious as cancer.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.040
This is your new home.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.520
-You are never to approach the farm again.
-Oh my gods!

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.600
Arvid, I will never forgive you this!

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.520
There's no reason to look
down your nose at this.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.840
I mean, I tried living in a house once.
This is much better.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.560
Except for the smell, of course.
The smell is better anywhere else.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.280
Jarl Varg, I choose to believe you
have learned a lesson here in Norheim.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.960
I have learned, Arvid.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.840
You are hard as flint
and a man of honor.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.960
And I'm sorry that you have become

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.040
Jarl Handless now, but...

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.720
we put our best
prosthetic smiths to work.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.120
And I must say
I'm incredibly proud of the result.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.800
Will you please raise your hands,
so we all can see?

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.240
Raise your hands.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.360
With this hand you can eat,
just as before.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.720
And the other one should work
just like a regular hand.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.560
Though with more stiff fingers.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.680
So I'd say perfectly adequate hands
there, I think we can agree on that?

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.720
Yes.
Perfect, Arvid.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.680
So, have a nice trip home.
I hope we can say we are even now.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.160
No hard feelings, now that you've
got both your hands back, right?

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.440
No hard feelings, Arvid.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.320
Seriously, no hard feelings?

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.840
Oh, yes, I have hard feelings.
Terrible and gruesome feelings.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.280
In my body.
I won't talk about it now.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.720
Strategy, my friend.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.680
Strategy.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.320
Viljar, don't you look nice!

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.080
-Thanks.
-Very excellent choice of fur.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.840
By the way, might you be interested
in a little digging tonight?

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.960
You don't happen to have
a dig-urge do you?

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.040
Not gonna happen,
Orm, Orm, Tapeworm.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.200
[laughing]

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.720
Tapeworm.
That's very funny, Viljar.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.840
You been saving that joke for a long time?
I've known you since you were two, Viljar.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.040
This is the first time
you've said anything funny!

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.080
Congratulations.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.040
Hildur!

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.640
My dear sister-in-law.
How's she doing?

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.760
Perfect. How about you?

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.880
-Fine, fine. Could've been better, but...
-I can see that.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.040
So, how do you feel about digging?
You like digging?

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.800
Mm... nope.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.920
Hildur, Hildur, don't you dare walk away
without digging me out!

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
That's just what I'm doing, Orm.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.400
I regret that I didn't have you
ravished when I had the chance!

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.480
Oh, good.
See? Blood is thicker than water.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.360
-There's a shovel over there.
-I don't need a shovel.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.560
[sighs]

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.360
Look what you made me do, Orm.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:09.040
You're spraying a little on me, too.
I don't know if that's your intention.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.120
I can't exactly turn away, you know.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.160
It's too late, it's too late.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.840
Hey!

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.640
Skål! 

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.760
Psst.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.200
-Psst.
-Who's that?

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.920
Who's that saying "psst"?

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.560
If that's some kind of harassment,
just knock it off.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.160
Some oral equivalent of peeing on me?

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.360
It's me. Liv.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.600
You truly are sent from Thor and Odin.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.480
I refuse to live with a semi-retarded
slave for the rest of my days.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.560
Believe it or not, I'd rather
escape with you.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.600
Because you are leaving, right?

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.240
Yes, yes.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.000
-In your face!
-In your face, Arvid!

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.560
Fucking Neanderthal!

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.560
-The birds have flown the coop!
-Too bad.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.800
Retards!
Inbred bastards!

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.040
My ass laughs at you, Arvid.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.120
And so does my assicle!

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.840
Yes, my...
What?!

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.360
This is not the last
you've seen of me, Arvid!

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.680
We'll be back!
The chieftain's seat will be mine!

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.240
-We're not going back!
-Yes, yes.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.920
-No, no, no.
-Yes, yes, yes, for vengeance.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.760
To revenge...

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.440
Row, Liv, row!

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.320
Wait, too close to shore! 

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.040
Hi! There you are!
I've been looking all over for you.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.640
I have some really fun news.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.000
What?

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.280
There's life inside me.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.520
A little Arvid!

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.000
Huh?

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.240
A little Arvid?
As in you, Arvid?

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.720
-I don't know.
-Yes, isn't that great?

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.760
And you know, I can feel it's a boy.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.000
A little chieftain!

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.840
Yes. But I don't want to interrupt.
You just go on.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.520
I'll see you inside.
Yes? OK.
