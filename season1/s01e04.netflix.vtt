WEBVTT

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.880
Let's see...

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.400
-Are you bringing a pillow?
-Pillow?

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.000
Yes, a pillow.
To put on the thwart.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.920
So your assicle doesn't fall asleep
after long sessions of rowing.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.120
I'm bringing mine.
Do you want me to bring yours?

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.680
No, I'm not bringing my pillow.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.400
No?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.520
Don't come running to me

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.680
asking for mine,
if you have second thoughts.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.160
No, thank you.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080
I don't understand Chieftain Orm.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.240
Thought you were done with
this raiding nonsense.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.160
Raiding is pretty much
our primary industry.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.920
We are Vikings, after all.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.120
How pathetic,
if our primary industry

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.120
is stabbing people with swords
and raping and pillaging.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.320
That just seems so year 770.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.600
We're destitute. Everything
has gone into those art projects.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.720
We have no choice.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.840
Not that you mind. I'm sure
you were very hard to convince.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.000
Well, I can't just sit at home
while everyone else is out raiding.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.120
That's not, that's not honorable.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.400
Don't make this about honor.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.440
And not the fact that you're
just really excited

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.120
to head out to sea
with your friends again.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.920
No matter what,
I will miss you like crazy.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.800
-Right.
-Yeah.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.880
-Have you seen my helmet?
-No, don't you only wear hats?

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.880
No, I have that helmet
I like to wear during battles.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.640
Let's see.
What else should I pack?

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.640
It's been such a long time
since I've been on a raid.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.120
So I've almost forgotten.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.320
-You've never been on a raid, have you?
-Yes, I have. A few times.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.840
-No.
-Yes.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.800
-No.
-Yes, yes.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.080
It was a long time ago, so,
you've probably just forgotten.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.760
It's OK to forget a few details.
You can't remember everything.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.840
Well, that I would have remembered.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.320
No, maybe there was too much blood
and gore going on for you then.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.320
You just stored that information
in a place

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.800
that your brain doesn't
give you access to.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.880
No.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.920
Well, that's a perfectly normal mechanism.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.120
You know, maybe you should just stay home,
since you don't find your helmet.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.240
Well maybe that's best for everyone.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.640
Oh, here it is!

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.920
-Yes!
-Yes...

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.360
Has it ever crossed your mind
that maybe I want to go raiding too?

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.320
You raiding?

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.760
You don't even like being in a boat.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.240
You always keep telling me
you hate the sea.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.040
That's beside the point, Arvid.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.960
The point is that it's really
nice to be asked. To be included.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.640
-To be seen.
-Yeah. Sure.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.160
So... Do you want
to come with us?

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.360
No! Ew.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.480
Do you have to walk around with
that gigantic cock necklace?

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.240
How do you think that will
make the men on the boat feel?

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.360
-I don't know.
-Tiny!

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.160
It's a kiss of death
for their self-confidence.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.120
Well, you want me to take it off then?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.200
As far as I'm concerned,
you're welcome to wear it.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.720
I have confidence enough
in my own sexuality.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120
-Good for you.
-Yes.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.240
I know that size doesn't matter one bit.
You know, it's like I always say:

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.000
It's not about the size of the boat,
but the motion of the ocean.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.880
Yes, you've said that many times now. Yes.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.720
That's because it's so true.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.800
So very, very true.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.360
You should try to come along once.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.280
Frøya always comes with us
and she loves it.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.880
Never gonna happen.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.280
Maybe it would open your eyes
to what we actually do.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.480
Maybe you'd respect it a little more.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.200
You're Vikings!
You have the easiest job in the world.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.680
Sit on a boat.
Stab people with swords.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.840
-It's as basic as it can possibly get.
-It's actually pretty demanding.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.760
Nope.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.520
[Orm]
Yes, good folk.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.920
It's time for another raid.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.480
In my absence you are to obey the
highest-ranking man in the village.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.800
Rufus.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.200
Rufus?!

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.440
But he's a slave!

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.120
Yes, that's true.
He was a slave.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.320
And now he's creative director
of the most exciting project

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.520
this side of the Midgard serpent.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.360
I assume everyone will carry the load
together, but just to make sure

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.120
I've hired an assistant for Rufus.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.480
Sturla Bonecrusher.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.360
Rufus, perhaps you'd like
to say a few words?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.720
Thank you.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.720
It's an honor to be allowed
to lead your village.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.520
And thank you, Orm,
for this vote of confidence.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.320
First on the agenda,
now that I'm a man of power,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.280
is to demand my cape back
from the one who stole it.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.360
That one. It's that one.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.960
Not everyone here knows me so well.
So allow me to introduce myself.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.000
I'm known as Rufus.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.560
But my full name is
Rufus Theodosius Claudianus.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.040
I'm an actor.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.440
Educated at the School
of Dramatic Arts in Rome.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.720
I spent three years there.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.560
Three fantastic years.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.800
Where I learned from some
of the best people in the business.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.800
I can mention some names.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.760
Claudio Elo.
Flavio Piginius. Enrico Noiosos.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.880
So many great artists, that just
passing on their knowledge to us.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.200
And for that I'm so grateful.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.520
He said: "You've got it. Inside you.
I want to see what's inside here."

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.320
"And I see that you're a great artist."

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.240
And that was really, a real
special experience for me.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.800
Because you have to
convey emotions, understand?

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.880
And ask questions.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.640
And leave it to the audience
to interpret them.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.840
And those of us left behind
will see to it that everything here

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.120
in our cultural capital
is in tip-top shape

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.960
when Orm and the barbarians return.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.840
Right, people?

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.320
Right, people?

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.360
Oi!

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.840
[all, half-hearted] Oi.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.320
Yes, yes.
Bravo. Bravo!

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Well said, Rufus, well said.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.680
Da capo! 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.520
Da capo! 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.720
Not da capo.
That's something else.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800
Mm.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.560
Hey, you.
Could you just help your chieftain?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.480
Just...

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.520
Splinter, splinter!

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.280
Loki!

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.960
Tell people to be careful by the
entrance. I just got a huge splinter.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.560
Not exactly comfortable,
to say the least.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.800
Well, well, well.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.720
Time for another raid.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.400
Time to swing the old sword again!

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.280
[sword splashes]

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.920
The sea giveth.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.960
And the sea taketh away.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.960
And this time the sea

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.040
tooketh

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.800
my sword.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.480
Arvid.
Frøya.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.240
What are those?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.800
The horns on your helmet.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.640
Are they simply decorative?

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.400
Or are you going to use them
to impale people, or what?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.480
Horns happen to be the latest fashion.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.160
You can't walk around
with horns on your helmet.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.320
It looks ridiculous.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.720
-Because you're such a fashionista?
-Yeah, or, yeah, yeah.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.400
Okay, so then you would probably
know that fashion is about

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.320
taking chances?
Experimenting?

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.800
Daring to be bold, while
at the same time of course

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.920
you have to wear something
that you feel comfortable in?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.600
Well, I sure wouldn't feel comfortable
with those horns on my helmet.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.680
Me neither.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.240
OK, Frøya, I can see
that you've tried. But Arvid?

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.240
-What is this?
-What do you mean?

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.720
This is no plan.
It's an old man's clothing.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.800
You're so risk-averse
it's painful to watch.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.120
Take a chance!

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.040
-Right.
-OK...

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.120
The helmet
is a basic headcover, right?

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.520
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.960
But when you add
some other material, like horns,

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.880
it becomes something else.
It's no longer just a helmet.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.440
It is something bigger.
It tells a story.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.880
And that is what fashion is all about.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.400
I'll see you on the boat.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.720
I can promise you that.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.960
Horns on the helmet
will never be popular.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.080
No.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.040
-He doesn't look like a Viking.
-No.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.320
No.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.520
She seems steady and secure, this one?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.600
-She should be fine.
-Yes.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.640
It sure will be nice
with a long trip now.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.440
Have you been on many raids?

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.600
-Yeah, some.
-Yes.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.080
I guess you can say that.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.400
The thing is, I was actually
saving this seat.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.240
Saving the seat?
For who?

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.960
Someone.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.400
Someone?
I know everyone here. Who?

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.880
Ragnar?

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.320
It's so special to sit with Ragnar
you can't sit with your chieftain?

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.080
Who just happens to be the most
important person on this boat?

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.920
No, not at all.
You just sit right here.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.920
I suppose Ragnar can

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.120
find somewhere else to sit, and...

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.120
It's just that
we usually sit together.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.800
-...sit together, yes.
-Yes.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.360
It wouldn't hurt
to mix things up a little.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.360
It's very important not to
get these cliques on board.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.840
And who knows, maybe some strong,
new friendships can develop?

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.560
This is more about,
you know, respecting

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.200
the saved-seats policy.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.000
Sure, I can find
somewhere else to sit.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.560
Good. Excellent.
That's settled then.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.680
-Then we'll sit. Yes.
-That's settled.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.400
And we could just

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.560
switch seats once we're out at sea.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.440
-Or not.
-Why don't we just play it by ear?

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.840
Yeah. I think you were going to
change seats very soon anyhow.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.080
No, I think maybe
we'll just stick to our regular seats.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.760
-We'll play it by ear.
-Or just decide right now.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.160
You can get really tired and
sore on your right side.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.800
But, no, but I have a pillow.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.240
Hello.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.560
So, this is what I want you to build.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.960
It's called a drawing.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.720
So this is where the acting
will take place.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.040
This is called a stage.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.120
The audience will sit around here
on benches. This goes up.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.880
-Up like that. Fine.
-Yeah.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.640
It has to do with the sound
and acoustics from the stage

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.280
So these layers indicate that
the rows go higher and higher.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.760
I think we may have to reinforce
those with a couple of girders.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.920
Yeah, you're the expert.
But I've drawn two entrances here.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
But see if it's possible for one
more entrance. If possible.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.360
That has to do with the construction
support, but we'll figure it out.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.400
Okay.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.080
-So you've got this?
-Yes, this looks fine. No problem.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.840
He says he's got it.
Excellent.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.840
Just remember that I accept nothing
but spectacular results.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.720
-I'm utterly uncompromising there.
-Of course.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.760
Sweet Odin!

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.800
Am I the only one who feels
queasy around here?

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.560
Probably.
What's your problem?

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.400
I'm experiencing

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.400
cold sweat, nausea, discomfort.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.040
Vomiting.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.880
You're seasick. It's completely normal
when you're on your first raid.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.320
No, I've been on many raids.
It can't be that.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.480
You know what's key now, for you?

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.000
It's to not focus on the horizon.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.320
OK?

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.040
Yeah. And then you drink
some warm goat milk.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.280
And then you go lie down in
the middle of the boat.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.160
And close your eyes.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.760
-And...
-Counteract.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.400
Counteract the motion of the sea.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.680
Yeah, that's the only thing
that helps. I'm telling you. Yeah.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.440
OK.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.800
-Goat milk?
-Yeah, goat milk.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.560
Pretty shitty work, eh?

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.000
Since you confiscated all our tools,
we have to dig with our hands.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.280
Well, you have to suffer for our art.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.480
That's just the way it is.
So keep up the good work!

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.240
Fuck off, you fucking slave!

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.560
Smart move.
Very smart move.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.280
Show them what happens to anyone
who opposes the creative director!

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.320
There!

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.840
That's what happens!

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.240
Consider that a lesson!

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.360
Listen...

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.760
I don't mean to tell you
how to do your job.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.160
But I was expecting something
more along the lines

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.640
of a slap.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.680
OK?

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.160
Or maybe like an Indian burn
or something, so?

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.240
Next time,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.120
maybe it's best
if you double-check with me

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.320
before you crush
someone's skull. OK?

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.840
Great.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.560
Good talk.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.720
[Arvid] See that one?
That's the North Star.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.960
And the one right
below the North Star?

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.360
That tiny little one
I just call The Dot.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.360
Because it looks like a dot.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.880
So,

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.600
how's married life?

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.280
Oh, it's fine.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.320
It's... yeah.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.960
I mean,
it's not exactly what I imagined.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.720
-You have to do a lot of boring stuff.
-Mm-hm.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.000
And then there's
all these emotional things.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.320
Yeah, that you're supposed to feel
something for each other

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.360
in order to enjoy
being with each other.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.600
I haven't really thought of it
like that before.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.240
[sighs]
I just...

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.040
enjoy so much
going on a raid again.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.400
Isn't it strange? We've been
on so many raids together,

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.040
yet we haven't really,
we haven't really spoken together.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.560
I guess I've always been

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.280
-a little shy. No, not really.
-Really?

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.080
Yes.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.760
You are shy.
Yes, you are.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.200
Yes!

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.920
Hello, everybody!

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.840
Hello. Hello, what's your name?

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.360
Sebastian.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.800
Sebastian. What a lovely
name! I'm Charlie.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.760
I've got a cold.
I've got a red nose.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.880
I'm going to sneeze!

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.400
My God.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.000
Charlie really is the only person

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.760
who can make
these poor, sick children smile.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.640
It's like their illness disappears
like the morning mist in the sun.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.080
Land!
I can see land!

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.120
Guys, wake up!
I can see land!

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.560
He truly is a blessing
to our community.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.160
-Will you be back tomorrow?
-Of course.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.600
Even though I have my work
at the animal shelter to attend to.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.680
-I'll be here every single day.
-Good.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.880
They really do love you,
these children, you know.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.080
And I love them too.
But today is a great day.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.600
I'm celebrating the end
of the fundraiser I've organized.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.600
Finally we have enough money
to build a proper hospital

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.000
for these poor children.
-Oh, Charlie!

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.680
You know, I do not like ranking people,

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.320
but you're truly the best
person I've ever met.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.360
You're most likely the best human
being in the whole of Britain.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.880
You... thank you very much.
You're very kind.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.160
I just do what I can.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.240
-Bye bye.
-God bless.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.160
Don't show any fear now, folks.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.640
Remember, nothing's sexier
than self-confidence!

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.320
-Don't look at me. He's your husband.
-Well, he's your chieftain as well.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:34.440
Yeah, but shouldn't he count double
for you? Chieftain and husband?

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.880
Arvid, you're sort of the leader
for the warriors.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.440
-Shouldn't you be taking care of this?
-No way!

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.800
I'm not saving Orm.
That's not my job.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.400
Thank you for coming
on this wonderful occasion.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.600
My heart is so full.
It started as a dream.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.160
Making the world a better place
for those less fortunate.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.000
And by God, the Holy Spirit,

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.280
I think we did it!

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.560
Orm!

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.400
-To the children.
-The children.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.640
Together, we have raised more money

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.120
than we could ever dream of.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.960
Money that will not only build
this new hospital

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.040
Charlie.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.600
these children have needed
for so long.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.240
But will also provide them

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.080
with invaluable education.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.200
-I could not have done this, of course,
-Excuse me, Charlie?

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.080
without you.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.560
You

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.960
have been the backbone
of everything I have done.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.640
[screaming]

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.880
What's going on?

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.000
-Where's the amphitheater?
-It's right here.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.080
The only thing I haven't solved
is the stage curtain,

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.880
but I think I have a solution.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.600
-OK?
-We use part of a pot-holder.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.480
I mean, that gives it weight and a bit of
a pattern.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.200
Don't you think that be cool?

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.720
-Yeah, that's cool.
-Wouldn't it though?

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.080
I mean, everything has to be
so modern these days.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.080
But a good old-fashioned pot-holder
is perfect. I'm glad you like it.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.080
Where do you envision
the actors standing on this stage?

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.560
Where do you picture
the audience sitting?

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.920
I don't... I think we have to solve that.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.160
But, I mean, we won't know
that until we've tried it.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.200
Let me put it this way:
How many people do you know

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.720
who are small enough
to sit on these benches?

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.040
How many tiny people do you know?

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.400
Who are small enough
to sit on these benches?

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.840
Of course!

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.720
The drawing was just supposed
to illustrate how it was gonna look.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.440
-Yes!
-Hey.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.560
I mean, my lord Odin.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.920
That one's on me, guys.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.240
I fully understand that slap.
My bad.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.640
Again!

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.040
Again!

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.040
Again!

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.520
Again!

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.520
[battle noises]

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.200
[whistling and laughing]

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.160
Stop, stop, stop!

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.960
Arvid, what in Hell
do you think you're doing?

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.080
We've just...

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.480
This one's mine!

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.520
Come on, Orm!

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.320
You can do it.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.120
Orm, come on!

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.320
Come on!

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.480
You can do it.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.880
You're the best!

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.680
Come on, Orm!

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.200
Orm...

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.360
She was strong!

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.240
And quick.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.320
Like a... weasel.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.600
Frøya?

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.280
So not only
were our enemies unarmed,

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.080
they also gathered
all the treasure for us in a chest

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.840
and made food and set the table.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.880
By Thor,
this raiding stuff is really easy.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.280
This just confirms that the gods
approve of our line of business.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.560
[laughing]

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.040
Keep up the pace!

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.160
We're building
a cultural stronghold here.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.360
And I expect nothing but perfection.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.240
Peasants.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.080
Chop chop!

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.360
Look at this.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.600
Here you are, working
in your simple manner.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.880
Oh, it's nice, isn't it?

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.360
Mm.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.400
-What do you think?
-Well, I think it's pretty good.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.360
-"Pretty good"?
-Mhm.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.400
And you're satisfied
with "pretty good"?

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.960
Is everyone here satisfied
with "pretty good"?

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.840
-How about you?
-Yes, I think it's nice.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.880
Do you know what I think?

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.360
This is what I think.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.600
Again.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.280
Rufus, I spent over a week on that!

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.320
Yeah.
And that's what frightens me.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.680
Suck a fart out of my ass.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.320
Excuse me?

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.680
We'll try harder.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.960
Good. Excellent.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.920
Ugh. What an ugly bucket!

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.600
What's the point of that?

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.080
Well, we have to draw the line somewhere.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.560
Even the buckets are to be
striking here in Norheim.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.920
It's the details we'll be measured by.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.480
I don't mean to interrupt
the creative director here,

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:24.800
but there's a lot of people are wondering
when we're gonna get paid.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.000
Well I don't have a single dinar on me
or whatever currency you use up here.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:33.840
And I told you that everyone gets paid
when Orm gets home from the raid.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.560
So stop nagging me.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.080
Let's just hope they don't, you know,
get lost at sea or something like that..

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.240
-For your sake.
-What do you mean?

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.400
It's just that, you know, people are
going to come to you for money.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.560
And starving people
tend to get a little

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.600
edgy. But what do I know, right?

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.760
Well, anyway, I have the Bonecrusher here,
so I'm not that worried.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.080
Come on.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.160
Come on!

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.960
Stop! Where are you going?

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.320
-Aren't you out of money?
-Yeah.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.560
I can't work for no pay.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.200
Pay?

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.520
Is pay, is money more important to you
than realizing my vision?

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.280
Yeah.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.920
You can't mean that!

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.600
Look me in the eye and say, say that.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.040
Money is more important
than realizing your vision.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.240
Then you're here
for all the wrong reasons anyway!

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.320
I can manage perfectly fine on my own.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.360
Maybe even better!

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.640
[crowd cheering]

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.160
[screaming]

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.280
[groans]
