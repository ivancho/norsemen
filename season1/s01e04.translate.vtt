1
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.600
Oh! Orm ...

2
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.400
Lets see ...

3
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.040
-Do you bring a pillow, right?
-Pillow?

4
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.240
To the top, not the race step
fall asleep when you have rowed for a long time.

5
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.920
- Should I pack yours?
- I'm not supposed to bring a pillow.

6
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.840
Now is your chance.

7
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.960
No thanks.

8
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.680
What is the chief Orm doing?
Aren't you done with those trips?

9
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.400
Looting is our primary industry.

10
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.000
It's so humbling. If the primary industry
is to kill, rap and burn.

11
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.320
- Isn't that very year 770?
- We're poor. We need the chicken.

12
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.600
Surely you are not against it?
You were probably hard to come by.

13
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.480
After all, I can't sit at home while
other looters. It is not honorable.

14
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.360
Is it about honor?
You're really looking forward to it!

15
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.680
Get out on the sea
with your friends ...

16
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.200
-I'll miss you anyway.
-Especially!

17
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.240
- Have you seen the helmet?
-Don't you just lie?

18
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.800
No, I have my helmet
I use when I fight.

19
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.000
What more ...
It's been so long since last time.

20
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.480
-You've never been on a cruise.
- I have.

21
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.760
Yes. But it's a long time ago. Maybe
you forgot about it. Of course that.

22
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.440
- You can't remember everything.
-But I remembered that.

23
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.400
Maybe there was too much blood and gut.
The brain does not give you access to it.

24
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.720
-No.
-It's natural, that.

25
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.880
Maybe you should just stay home,
since you can't find the helmet?

26
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.600
Here it is!
Yep.

27
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.360
-What if I want to join the cruise, then?
-You?

28
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.200
You don't even like being in a boat.
You hate the sea.

29
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.760
It's about being asked.
Feel included. Be seen.

30
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.840
Would you like to join the cruise, then?

31
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.960
No! Uh ...

32
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.440
Do you have to wear that giant dick chain?
How do men feel then?

33
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.280
Tiny little ones.
Think about their confidence.

34
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.400
- Should I take it off, then?
- No, not for my part.

35
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:47.600
-I am confident in my own sexuality.
-Fine for you, then.

36
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.240
I know size doesn't matter.

37
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.720
It's not about the size
on the boat, but the movement in the sea.

38
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.840
-You've said that a few times now.
- That's because it's very true.

39
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.880
You should join the cruise once.
Frøya is always there.

40
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.800
-It's so out of date.
-You could get respect for it.

41
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.920
Vikings. The world's easiest job.
Sit in a boat, stab people with swords.

42
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.280
- It's actually quite demanding.
-No.

43
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.440
folks,
then it's time for the cruise again.

44
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.480
In my absence you shall obey
the man with the highest rank here:

45
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.760
-Rufus!
-Rufus? He's a slave after all.

46
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.320
He was slave. Now he is creative
leader of this exciting project.

47
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.920
I expect everyone
want to join and pull the load, -

48
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.760
- but I still have
  provided an assistant.

49
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.600
Sturla Bone crusher.
Rufus, would you say some words?

50
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.720
Thanks. It is an honor for me to lead
their village. Thank you for your trust.

51
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:21.240
The first point is to order
back the cap from the one who took it.

52
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.160
He there.

53
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.880
Not everyone knows me
so good, but my name is Rufus.

54
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.320
My full name is
Rufus Theodosius Claudianus.

55
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.520
I am an actor, went three years
at the Theater College in Rome.

56
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.840
Three amazing years where I learned everything
by some of the best people in the business.

57
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.000
I can mention Claudio Aelo,
Flavio Peginius, Enricos Noiosos ...

58
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.840
As many amazing artists as
gave all the knowledge they had to me.

59
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.520
I want to see what's inside here,
he said.

60
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.840
It is a scathing experience
for a little theater spire.

61
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.280
There are emotions that need to be conveyed.
And then we'll ask questions, -

62
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.960
- but we have to leave it to the audience
  to interpret the questions.

63
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.840
Then we have to make sure that everything
is the tip of the cultural front -

64
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.920
- when Orm and the barbarians come home.

65
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.160
Well said, Rufus.

66
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.000
Dakapo!
Dakapo!

67
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.120
Not dakapo.
It's something else.

68
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.680
You, can you ...
Help your chieftain.

69
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.640
Take it.

70
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.200
Ouch! Tiles!
Oh, Loke ...

71
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.880
Ask people to be a little careful, too
now I got a huge chip in my finger.

72
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.120
Yes ...

73
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.360
Then it was
time to go on a cruise again.

74
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:58.880
Time to swing a bit
on the old sword ...

75
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.720
The ocean provides, and the ocean takes.

76
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.240
And right now, the ocean was taking my sword.

77
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.400
-Arvid! Frøya!
- What's that?

78
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:25.720
Horn on the helmet? Are they for decoration,
or should you spit people with them?

79
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.040
-Horn is the latest in fashion.
-It looks completely dusty.

80
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.400
-For you know a lot about fashion?
-Yes. Or ... Yes.

81
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.800
Then you know that fashion is all about
to take chances, dare to be daring?

82
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.080
While comfortable?

83
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.360
I had not felt comfortable
with horns on the helmet.

84
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:57.240
I can see that Frøya has tried,
but Arvid ... What's this?

85
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.600
There is no plan, after all.
Old man clothes, like.

86
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.720
Take a risk!
Don't be so confident.

87
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:11.040
-Saklig.
-The helmet is a basic garment.

88
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.880
But as you
adds some new horn -

89
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.160
- then you have a garment
  that tells a story.

90
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:27.680
And that's what fashion is all about.
Seen on the boat, then.

91
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.080
Horn on the helmet
never becomes part of the fashion image.

92
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.760
Doesn't look very viking,
to put it that way.

93
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:44.000
Solid. Really solid.
Solid craftsmanship, right?

94
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.560
He must be fine, he.

95
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.840
Will be good with a long trip now.
Have you been on many trips before?

96
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.760
Yes. There have been some. Can say that.

97
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.520
This is going to be so good ...

98
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.160
- I really liked the place.
- To whom then?

99
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.360
-A guy.
-Who?

100
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.560
Ragnar?

101
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:25.240
Is it more wonderful to sit with
Ragnar than with your chieftain?

102
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:33.000
No, just sit, you. I am sure that
that Ragnar can find another place.

103
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.120
-But we tend to sit together.
- Then we mix it up a bit.

104
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:44.520
We can't have clicks here.
New friendships can be formed?

105
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.800
It's more about it
to respect places and things like that.

106
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.760
I can certainly find
another place to sit, i.

107
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.480
- Then we can smoke when we come out.
-Or not.

108
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.760
-We can see it a bit ...
- We have enough fixed seating.

109
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.400
-We see it, then.
- Or we decide that now.

110
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:18.920
-It might be good to switch some.
-Or okay with fixed seats.

111
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.600
-You can be stole on the right ...
-Yes, but I have a pillow, me.

112
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.600
Hey Hey.

113
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:35.640
Here you can see what to build.
It's called a work drawing.

114
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.800
Here we have to play theater.
This is a scene.

115
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:47.240
- The audience sits on benches upwards.
-Upwards?

116
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.200
It has to do with acoustics and sound.

117
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.880
What looks like layer upon layer,
going higher and higher.

118
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.440
-We reinforce with some dragons.
-You are the expert on it.

119
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.720
I have drawn two entries,
but see if we can get to three.

120
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.560
It has to do with the support structure
to do, but we do.

121
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.520
- So you have control?
-Yes, this looks fine.

122
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.920
He says he has control.
Great. Gorgeous.

123
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:27.920
But remember, I accept nothing else
than spectacular work.

124
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.080
Yes, yes.

125
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.120
Oh ...

126
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.440
Am I the only one who is bad?

127
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.960
I think so.
What is wrong with you?

128
00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:04.280
I am cold sweating and nauseous,
discomfort and vomiting ...

129
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.560
You're seasick.
Quite common on the first trip.

130
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.160
I've been on a cruise before,
so it's not that.

131
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:20.760
Do you know what's important now?
Don't look at the horizon.

132
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:28.400
And then you drink some warm goat's milk,
and lie down on the desert.

133
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:37.000
-And working against ...
- Counteract the movement in the sea.

134
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.200
-Geitemelk?
-Yes.

135
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.240
-For a third job, then.
-You've seized all the tools!

136
00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:00.200
Yes, you have to suffer for the art.
That's just how it is! Stand on!

137
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.120
Shit and go, slave bastard!

138
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.520
Now you were smart.
Very clever.

139
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:17.560
Show them what's going on
those who defy creative leadership.

140
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:40.240
Yes. That's what happens!
Look at it as a lesson!

141
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.880
Now this is your job -

142
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.760
- but I really only had
  set me an ear bud.

143
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:55.760
Or heavy coconut, or something.
French cuff, maybe.

144
00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:03.480
So next time it's fine if you take
a double check with me first. Ok?

145
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.720
It's good we got to talk a little.

146
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.920
That is the Polar Star.

147
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:26.840
And the one who is a little under there,
I just call it Dot.

148
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.280
It looks like a dot.

149
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.360
But you ...

150
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.480
-How's life like a married man?
-It's just fine.

151
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.160
Maybe not like I thought.

152
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:52.520
Very boring stuff one must be
with on. And that kind of feeling.

153
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.880
You have to feel something for each other
to have a good time together.

154
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.920
I've never thought of it that way.

155
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.200
I just know that
am digg to be on the cruise again.

156
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.200
Little wonder we have been on a cruise
without talking properly.

157
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:21.400
- I've always been a little shy.
-Are you shy?

158
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.680
Hello everybody!

159
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.680
-What's your name?
-Sebastian.

160
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.720
My name is Charlie.

161
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.760
Oh, I'm cold.
I have a red nose. I have to sneeze ...

162
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:07.800
Oh, Charlie is the only one who can get
these poor sick children to smile.

163
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:13.880
It's like the disease
disappears like dew before the sun.

164
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.480
Land in sight!
Folks! Land in sight!

165
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.400
All up!
The legs on the desert!

166
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.560
He is truly a blessing.
Are you coming tomorrow too?

167
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:39.320
Yes. I also help Animal Protection,
but should I come every single day.

168
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.760
-Good. The kids are so happy about you.
-I love them too.

169
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:50.120
This is a great day. I have to celebrate
that the fundraiser is over.

170
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:55.560
Now we can finally build
a proper hospital for these children.

171
00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:03.000
I don't like to rate people, but you
is the kindest man I have met.

172
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.600
You have to be the kindest
man throughout Britain.

173
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:13.360
Thank you so much.
I do as best I can.

174
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.960
-Good bye.
-God bless you.

175
00:18:53.600 --> 00:19:00.360
Don't show fear now, folks. remember that
nothing is more sexy than confidence.

176
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.560
You, we're not quite ashore ...

177
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:15.640
-Don't look at me, it's your husband.
-Yes, but he is - everyone's chief.

178
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.480
But then he should count double
for you. Chief and man, like.

179
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:27.960
Arvid. You're like the leader too
warriors. Shouldn't you arrange?

180
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.680
No. I'm not saving Orm.
That's not my job.

181
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.000
Thank you
so you could come.

182
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.160
My heart is flooded.
It began as a dream.

183
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:47.560
Making the world a better place for them
who are not so lucky. And by God ...

184
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.560
I think we've got it done!

185
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.320
Oh ... Orm.

186
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.040
For the children!

187
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:26.680
Together we have collected
more money than we could have dreamed.

188
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:32.160
Money not just to be spent
to a new hospital for these children, -

189
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.720
- but also give them
  priceless education.

190
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.840
I could not
clear this without you.

191
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.720
You have been the foundation
in everything I've done.

192
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.960
Robin of Wessex.

193
00:20:53.280 --> 00:21:00.440
Elizabeth of Cumbria.
Don't just build this hospital ...

194
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.520
What's up?
Where is the Amphitheater?

195
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.640
Here.

196
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.640
I haven't solved the stage carpet yet,
but it works out.

197
00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.400
Okay.

198
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:28.280
We use part of a pot of cloth.
Then you get heavier and a little pattern.

199
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.800
- Don't you think it's going to be cool?
-That would have been cool.

200
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:39.040
Everything must be so modern, but one
a good old pot of cloth is perfect.

201
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.480
Where should the actors be
on that stage there?

202
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.080
Where should the audience sit?

203
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.040
We do not know that until we have tried.

204
00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.840
How many do you know that are small enough
to sit on those benches there?

205
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:05.720
How many tiny little people
do you know who can fit in there?

206
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:14.480
Oh ... Of course. The drawing
should just show how it looked.

207
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.800
Lord Odin.
Long nose on me, please.

208
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.080
-Full understanding of it.
-Again!

209
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.080
Again!

210
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.880
Again!

211
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.160
Again!

212
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.440
(The sound of Viking attacks)

213
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.520
Stop, stop, stop!

214
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.840
Arvid, what in Helheim
are you doing?

215
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.880
We just ...

216
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.880
She's mine.

217
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.560
Oh!

218
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.960
Come on, you got it!

219
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.680
Come on, Orm!

220
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.920
She was strong! And fast.
Like a noise tax.

221
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.200
Frøya?

222
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.400
So, not enough
that the enemy was without weapons,

223
00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:30.560
- but they have collected all the treasures
  in a coffin and they have cooked ...

224
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.920
It is easy to be on a cruise, that is.

225
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:39.480
It is a confirmation that the gods
appreciate what we do.

226
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.760
Oh!

227
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:24.480
Stand on! We are building a cultural
stronghold. No mediocrity.

228
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.640
Yokels.
Get up to speed.

229
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.120
Here you work in your simple way.

230
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.960
It'll be fine, right?

231
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.800
- What do you think, then?
-I think it's pretty good.

232
00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.880
Pretty good, yes.
Are you happy with "pretty good"?

233
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.200
-What about you?
-I think it was fine.

234
00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.440
Do you know what I think?
This I think:

235
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.280
Again.

236
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:23.480
-I have used it for over a week.
-And that scares me.

237
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.040
- Suck a fuck out of my ass.
-That it was?

238
00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:34.000
-We will work very hard going forward.
-So good! It was no worse than that.

239
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.400
What a nasty bucket, then.

240
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.080
What are you doing?

241
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.000
Even the buckets should be
remarkable. Details!

242
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.320
It is not intended
to disturb the creative leader -

243
00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:02.360
- but some people wonder
  when they have to get paid for this.

244
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.000
Everyone gets paid when Orm
comes home with the booty.

245
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.520
I don't have a single dinar,
or whatever you use.

246
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.000
Let's hope they don't
lose or something, then.

247
00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:21.360
People come to you
to get paid.

248
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:27.320
And the hungry people get fast
a bit unsightly. But what do I know?

249
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:33.400
Anyway, I have the Leg Crusher here,
so I'm not very concerned.

250
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.680
Come on.

251
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.360
What happens then?
Hello! Stop it!

252
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.520
- Don't you go?
- Is it running out of money?

253
00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.920
-Yes.
-I can't work without getting paid.

254
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.720
Money is more important to you
than realizing my vision?

255
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.880
You can't believe that!
Look me in the island and say it!

256
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.960
Money is more important
than realizing your vision!

257
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:35.040
Yes. Then you are here for everyone
the "wrong" reasons anyway, then.

258
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:41.760
Just go! I am doing fine.
Maybe even better!

259
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.440
I am creative leader ...
