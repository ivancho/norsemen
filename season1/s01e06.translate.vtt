1
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:11.680
I know it's one of you.
But he looks almost like a woman.

2
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.280
He is feminine.
A terrible character.

3
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.720
Nasty. Unpleasant.

4
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.640
-Look! There we have Orm!
-No!

5
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.640
Obviously a master of disguise.

6
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.760
But you can't handle the nut bag
hide with makeup and costume.

7
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.560
We have found
a secret exit.

8
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.600
Orm has escaped.

9
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.840
-Stop! Stop, stop ...
-What is it?

10
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.440
-Keep. It's definitely hold.
- You have a team ?!

11
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.760
-We should not try to get us ...
-The team eats me up from the inside.

12
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.200
- Hold is not so bad then!
-I have extremely high pain threshold.

13
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.920
This is a pain. They actually say
that holding is worse than giving birth.

14
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.600
We stay here.

15
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.800
Is there one person I didn't believe
should be able to escape, then it's Orm.

16
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
He can't have come far.

17
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.040
Only one thing.
What happened down there ...

18
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160
If you think I've been -

19
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.640
- involved in gay activity,
  then you are thoroughly wrong.

20
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.240
Hot sex with a man -
does it get more gay than that?

21
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.480
Sure, but it's like ...
According to the Viking law -

22
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.000
- so you have not participated
  in an illegal gay activity -

23
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.560
- as long as you are the active party.

24
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.360
That's why I was
so active with counter-jokes and ...

25
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.240
It was a real dance of life.

26
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.960
And what's important,
is that the Viking law is clear about it.

27
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.800
As long as you are
the active party, -

28
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.960
- it's not illegal,
  and no honor is lost.

29
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.600
-So you haven't lost any honor?
-No. No. Absolutely not.

30
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.400
On the contrary.

31
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.560
Orm!

32
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.000
I know you guys have looted west!
All I need is the map!

33
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.920
I'm saving your life
if i get the map!

34
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.760
Everyone else becomes a slave,
but you are safe. Orm!

35
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.880
Nobody agrees to such a deal.

36
00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.240
Lord Odin, he really believes
that you are so cowardly? What? Orm?

37
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.200
Orm!
No, Loke, ass.

38
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.040
Orm!

39
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.440
Here I am! Here I am!
Here I am ...

40
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.600
I'm here.
I hadn't left.

41
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.600
Here ...

42
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.960
Now I hope you have what I want.

43
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.880
-Coward!
- They would do the same!

44
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
- No one here had sacrificed his village.
- Easy for you to say safe inside the cage!

45
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.480
Look here. I was going to give it to you
all the time, so this feels good.

46
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.200
Oi.

47
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.400
What's this, Orm?

48
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.400
Big penises and ass holes ...

49
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.120
- This is not a map.
-Maybe a map of the body?

50
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.800
Check here.

51
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.600
Orm! Orm!
Blood eagles are very old.

52
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.520
I hope you're ready.

53
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.160
No no!
Not! Not!

54
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.640
I know where the map is!
Arvid has it.

55
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.280
Arvid. The backward
Olav's right hand?

56
00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.400
It was I who was the right hand,
but he was the brain behind the cruise.

57
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.600
It was he who hid the map.
I know his weak point!

58
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.960
Pardon ...
It's not meant to interfere, -

59
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.240
- but is there a Life here?

60
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.520
Yes. That's me.

61
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.800
Yes, you should be violated in public.

62
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.600
-What? Ravished?
-Yes.

63
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.360
Raped.
Public.

64
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.840
Yes, it is just to complain.
That's not my idea at all.

65
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.240
- It's part of the thing.
-Does the Earl do it himself, right?

66
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.400
Yes, you should not ignore that.

67
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.360
I can't guarantee anything,
but you get to cross your fingers.

68
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.640
- Stay with me, you.
-It's going to go well.

69
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:15.720
It's right out there. Good bye.
You can go first ...

70
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.000
Arvid!
I need that map!

71
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.920
No honorable men leave the woman
its being violated in public!

72
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.240
Loke, ass.

73
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.400
-This is not honorable.
- I almost have to do something, right?

74
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.760
You cannot attack everyone with a knife.
It is not a strategically correct choice.

75
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:04.080
-Magnus? Voldta Arvid's wife.
- Of the man in the street? Unacceptable.

76
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:10.720
Any other day
I just wore the suit.

77
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.280
But there's been so much going on
the invasion here and long horse ride, -

78
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.240
- so I don't feel fresh.

79
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.840
Hakon!
Rape.

80
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.520
I'm not
so comfortable with that, Varg.

81
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:39.000
Thinking of the wife. If she gets
just about this, she gets bored.

82
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.600
Is it possible?
Do I have to do everything myself?

83
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.480
Rape of an Earl, yes.

84
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.240
I can't wait to know
power pumped into me.

85
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.760
Violent as she was then.

86
00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.480
- Try to be quiet now.
-I just got a little anxious.

87
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.760
What about the pillow? Then comes
the seeds easier in the food tract.

88
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.880
She doesn't think clearly.

89
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.720
Can you turn away?

90
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.440
That goes for you in the cage too!
Turn away.

91
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:24.120
I don't need a hundred staring
glance when I drive and violate.

92
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.040
Now we just concentrate,
and then we drive on ...

93
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.360
Just work a little ...

94
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.760
Arvid!
This is the last warning!

95
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:43.480
Now it's just before penetration!
We are soon belly-brothers-in-law!

96
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.600
- We're getting started!
- I almost have to attack.

97
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.560
It's possible I have an idea. I know
maybe about someone who can help us.

98
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.160
-You need a lot of blood ...
-Arvid! Stay away!

99
00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.760
Now I can get earrings into me!

100
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.880
Shit and go.
You had an idea?

101
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.600
This is a jackpot, you hear it?

102
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.160
Just ...
No, don't be harsh. Like that.

103
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.840
What?

104
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.360
There I put a line.
This was just a warning, Arvid!

105
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.960
In other circumstances,
warmer weather -

106
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.640
- happy people,
  had your wife drowned in semen!

107
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:38.400
In all the beautiful, powerful
the earring sperm I carry!

108
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.640
Warning, Arvid!
Warning!

109
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.280
There.
There you have your army.

110
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.280
Eirik?

111
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.800
Uncle Oddvar?

112
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.120
That's Arvidsen, yes!

113
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.240
- They are dead long ago!
-No, we live then, we.

114
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.080
Yes, in a kind of middle world, then?

115
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.400
Not quite Valhall, because you guys
has anything undone here on earth?

116
00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:01.480
No ... We should
really taken the clan, -

117
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:07.800
- but it goes against the instincts
  to plunge into death from a cliff.

118
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.000
It becomes so "lemenete".

119
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:19.160
I just have to sit down
and try to understand what's going on here.

120
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.240
Now I understand what the misunderstanding was about. You live.

121
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.440
-But willing to fight for me?
-Of course!

122
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:53.680
If we fall into conflict, it becomes Valhall,
so this is an ideal situation.

123
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:59.400
It sounds awesome.
Let's make a plan.

124
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.080
I have struggled myself
with the blood supply down there.

125
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.200
Especially with his wife.

126
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.520
Other times it stands like a stick.

127
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:36.880
The meat whistle always plays its own
melody. Isn't that what they say?

128
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:50.080
Either way, you can comfort yourself
that the West is overrated.

129
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.680
We have something much more valuable.

130
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.840
-Diamanter?
-No no no. More than that.

131
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.200
-Rubiner?
-Theatre.

132
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.280
Theatre?

133
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:19.000
Do I get any key people from the cage,
you should get a taste of the summer game.

134
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.840
Theatre ...

135
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:41.520
-Trangsynt! Parochial!
-Avsinn! Avsinn!

136
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.000
-Avsmak.
-Avsmak.

137
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.000
-Shame!
-Shame!

138
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.560
Ho loves you!

139
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.600
Ho loves you!

140
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.760
Oh!

141
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.800
It's hard to imagine
without the right means, so ...

142
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:51.280
We did not get warm up, and
did not come up in the high parties ...

143
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.840
- This is ...
- Can we do it again?

144
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.800
I never experienced ...

145
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.440
I knew I got ...
It came like that ...

146
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.160
... strange liquid out of ...

147
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.800
... my eye.

148
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:19.040
I think most of all that I learned
a lot about myself and society.

149
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.160
(It blows in a goat's horn.)

150
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.640
Look there, yes.
There comes the pig to the slaughterhouse.

151
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.840
- I thought he was alone?
-He was the last time I saw him.

152
00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:00.200
The Vikings are in the cage,
so I know then Loke who they are.

153
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.200
Varg!

154
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.200
Come on, then, chuckle.
Send me to Valhall.

155
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:46.120
Firstly
I'm not a jerk.

156
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.360
I have a sore back, right?

157
00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.840
It causes the stomach to bulge a little.
The spine goes inwards.

158
00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.000
Secondly, I save your life.
I realize you've been fooled.

159
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.200
Yes ... The wisest is.
Is not that what they say?

160
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.080
Here you really show magnificence.

161
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.200
You show that you can post
conflicts behind you quickly -

162
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:27.600
- and don't dwell on stupid things
  as others have done.

163
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.120
-Thanks.
-It requires her husband.

164
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:37.360
At least your chieftain is
incredibly, incredibly proud of you.

165
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:43.120
Yes. No, but then I think
that I take over the reins again.

166
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:49.480
We must not dwell on it
who actually heads Norheim.

167
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.760
That could have gone really bad.

168
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.680
Arvid!
Arvid! Arvid ...

169
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:10.680
Yes, you must try,
but I don't think it works.

170
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.360
Then we have
learned a lesson today.

171
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:21.960
Don't let an evil enemy live and turn around
his back to him if he has attacked.

172
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:28.040
I hope people remember it, saw it
does not happen several times in history.

173
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:35.760
And I'm so tactile!
Arvid! Arvid ...

174
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.240
Hello.

175
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:53.080
Chief Arvid. Who had
dreamed that you would be?

176
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.440
At least I had dreamed about it.
Chief Olav dreamed about it.

177
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.400
But I wondered one thing.

178
00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.440
Do you think that's okay?
that a human being has a weakness?

179
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:12.600
-No one can be perfect all the time.
- No, there's something to it.

180
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.440
And I have one small weakness.
I love power.

181
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.040
I am drawn to power
like moths against the flame.

182
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:28.240
Olvar was sugary, you were so strong,
and Earl Varg was the Earl.

183
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.600
No wonder the ladies
throwing himself over him.

184
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:38.200
-He's a psychopath and very evil.
-No, it was more of a role he played.

185
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:44.080
- Were you attracted to him?
- Nothing happened.

186
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:50.320
-I hope you can forgive me now.
-Of course. I sure can.

187
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:56.680
-Can we start with blank runes?
-Yes, we can certainly do that.

188
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
- Hello, Kark.
-Greetings!

189
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.480
Do you fit in the bin?
New roommate.

190
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:12.080
-If it's a heart room, it's a bingroom.
-You're kidding me now, Arvid?

191
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.600
This is your new home.
Just forget to come back to the farm.

192
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.880
Arvid!
This I never forgive you!

193
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.960
Don't laugh at your nose.
This is much better than a house.

194
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.480
Except for the smell, then.

195
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:43.000
Jarl Varg. I choose to believe you
has learned a lesson here in Norheim.

196
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:52.120
I've learned, Arvid. You are
hard as flint and a man of honor.

197
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.240
Sorry you became Earl Handless.

198
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.360
But our best
prosthetists were on the case, -

199
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.080
- so I'm pretty proud
  above the result.

200
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.720
Up with her hand so everyone can see.

201
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.400
Must show them.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

202
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.080
What?

203
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.520
With one hand
you can eat as usual.

204
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:28.280
The other is like a normal hand,
only with slightly stiffer fingers.

205
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:34.000
Almost full hands there.
Surely we can agree on that?

206
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.280
- Complete, Arvid.
-You must have a good trip home.

207
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.360
I hope we are well.
No hard feelings with new hands.

208
00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.720
No, no hard feelings, Arvid.

209
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.840
Seriously? No hard feelings?

210
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:57.520
Obviously I have hard and
cruel feelings that ride in me.

211
00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.720
We are not talking about it now.

212
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.240
Strategy, my friend.
Strategy.

213
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:22.840
Viljar! So stylish you are tonight.
Good choice of fur.

214
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:29.560
Would you like to dig a little
tonight, right? Do you have an itch?

215
00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.000
It's reasonably outdated,
Bendel-Orm.

216
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.200
It was fun! Do you have
saved on that joke for a long time, right?

217
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.440
I've known you for a long time,
and this is your first time having fun!

218
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:49.000
Hildur! Hi!
Dearest sister-in-law. How is the situation?

219
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.800
-Very good. And you?
-Fine. Could have gone better.

220
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.680
-See it.
-You, are you fond of digging, right?

221
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.320
-No.
- Don't go until you've dug me up!

222
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:11.200
I regret it
that I didn't hurt you!

223
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:17.360
So good. Blood is thicker than water.
The spade is there ...

224
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.120
-I don't need a shovel just yet.
-What do you think ...

225
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.960
Oh ... Look what you got
made me do it, Orm.

226
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.400
Now it's a little squirting on me here.
I don't know if that's the point ...

227
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.320
I can't turn away either ...

228
00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.960
Now the damage has happened.

229
00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.440
Hi!

230
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.880
Toast!

231
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.720
Pst!

232
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:24.080
What? Who says pst?
If there is harassment, then cut it out.

233
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.160
What's the fun of it?

234
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:34.360
-That's me. Life.
-You are as sent from Tor and Odin.

235
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.760
I refuse to live together
with a slave! Are you going to go?

236
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.760
Yes, we have to go.
Come on!

237
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.640
Too bad, Arvid!

238
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:58.000
-The birds have flown!
-Sin! Damn Neanderthals!

239
00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.240
Fuck me laughing at you!

240
00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.760
-And the race step too!
-What?

241
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.640
This is not the last thing you have seen
by me, Arvid! We will be back!

242
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.840
- We're not going back?
-Yes, we have to get revenge, right.

243
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.840
Ouch! Oh!
It stings!

244
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:37.160
Hi! There you are. I have easy everywhere.
I have some real fun to tell.

245
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.600
It's life.
Inside here.

246
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.240
A little Arvid.

247
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:49.160
A little Arvid ...
Like you, Arvid?

248
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.240
-Do not know.
- I can tell it's a boy.

249
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.160
A little chieftain.
Isn't it fun?

250
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:05.440
I'm not going to disturb.
I just had to say it. See you in there!
