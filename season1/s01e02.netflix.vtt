00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.160
[choking]

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.640
What the fuck is...

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.880
Inbred bastards!

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.160
Come on.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.800
Turn that frown upside down.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.120
Smile to the world.
That's all there is to it.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.760
I was awakened by two filthy men
relieving themselves in my mouth!

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.560
I think I may have swallowed
some of it.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.160
Number two?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.720
What? No!

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.120
Then you've got nothing
to be down in the mouth about.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.400
Pee straight from the source
is perfectly sterile.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.000
Doesn't taste half bad either.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.920
It actually does. It tastes extremely bad.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.760
You'll soon learn to love
these small gags.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.840
You have to take your hat off. The Vikings
are real creative in that area.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.960
I'm not taking my hat off
to being pissed in the mouth!

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.960
I'm not doing that.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.560
OK, keep it on, then.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.640
[screams]

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.600
You cheap whore! 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.640
-No!
-Stay down!

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.640
No, you killed my husband! 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.640
Just penetrate me,
but spare the children!

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.440
I think I need a break, or something.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.400
A break? I didn't even
know we had started.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.200
Grab some water or something, I...

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.400
OK. This is just stupid. Huh?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.560
I started thinking too much
and got all stressed.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.680
OK, everyone just get up!
The new husband is failing as usual.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.320
It just hangs there like a snail.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.800
I'm really sorry. As I said,
I started thinking too much.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.000
I forgot to feel,
and got all stressed.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.480
I mean, everyone here at the farm is doing
everything they can to accommodate you.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.080
And it still isn't enough.
What's wrong with you?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.400
I was just trying to get in the mood.
It was an experiment, you know.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.200
I know that your sexual experience only
consists of brute force and rape.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.560
So why this isn't good enough,
you really have to explain.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.240
Well you know, with them it was...

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.400
They meant nothing to me, so.
And with you, we're married.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.200
And I suppose we are, well,
we are very much in love.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.040
-I think you're so pretty, and...
-That's really sweet.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.200
-You think so?
-Yeah.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.440
You want to know what I think?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.560
I think it's extremely embarrassing.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.360
For everyone.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.600
And it's all your fault.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.400
You're not running off
to the archery field, Arvid!

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.560
There's a lot to do on
the farm today! Arvid!

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.640
Imagine, guys.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.760
My last day as a slave.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.280
I've toiled for over twenty years.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.600
And today, once I return my ax
to the toolshed,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.640
I'm a free man.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.000
-What are you planning on doing?
-Where should I start?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.480
I want to sample
everything life has to offer.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.120
Soak up impressions.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.400
Especially visual impressions.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.440
You've always been an aesthete.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.320
I love looking at things.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.120
To stare.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.320
Glance. Gaze. Squint.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.200
Glare and gawk.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.880
Ogle.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.680
Study. Observe.
Eyeball.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.720
And finally learn to read.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.640
These two eyeballs
sure are going to be used!

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.520
Arvid!

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.400
[arrow whistling]

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.840
Hey, what is that?

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.040
I don't see anything.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.680
Yeah, yeah. There are
two very sharp objects

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.040
zooming towards...

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.560
You have to learn how to communicate!

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.000
-That's what you do in a relationship!
-[screaming]

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.720
They were arrows!

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.720
In the name of Loki!

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.560
Do something.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.200
Pull them out.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.640
No, don't pull them out!

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.120
-They have barbs.
-You can't know that.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.080
Anyway, you can't walk around with two
arrows sticking out of your head.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.640
Listen to him.
I mean, it'll be too much of a hassle.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.080
Imagine sleeping on your stomach.
It would be impossible.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.280
A lot of things would be impossible.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.240
They have to come out, OK?

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.960
Just take it easy, now.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.880
We're going to save your vision, OK?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.880
[screaming]

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.400
It'll be easier if you stop squirming.
Trust us now. On three.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.880
One, two, three!

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.520
I...

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.440
I can't see anything.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.640
Was the operation a success?

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.120
No, it wasn't a success at all.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.800
It's awful.
I can see straight into your head.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.080
You were right
about those barbs, though.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.160
Did you just come from the forest?

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.280
-All alone?
-Yeah.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.360
-No guards?
-Nope.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.160
-Why didn't you run away?
-Run away? Why would I run away?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.520
I'm here of my own free will.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.520
What do you mean?

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.560
I was freed in the mid '80s,
I think. '86.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.640
Huh?

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.360
It just felt so wrong for me out there.
I mean, everything goes so fast.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.880
It's just a totally different
pace out there.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.840
OK.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.360
I feel better
in the strict confines here.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.200
-So you've been institutionalized right?
-Yeah.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.400
I mean, there's no better feeling
than doing

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.520
backbreaking work
for someone else without pay.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.920
-So a lot of things feel better than that.
-I seriously doubt it.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.040
Anyway, just give this time.
I guarantee you're gonna love it.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.720
Yeah?

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.880
Where's that miserable slave
who's responsible for my fireplace?

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.400
It's freezing in here!
I prefer it more temperate.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.640
Yes.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.760
Find him immediately!

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.600
This is gonna cost him an ear!

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.400
He's gone!

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.280
-He's gone?
-Nowhere.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.360
-Can't find him.
-Blow the horn.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.000
Ragnar, FrÃ¸ya,
look for tracks on the north side.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.240
Viljar, you bring two guys,
see if there are any boats missing.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.840
Arvid, you stay with me.
Let's find this miserable slave.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.800
[Liv] Arvid?

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.600
What in the name of Loki
do you think you're doing?

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.560
-Going on a raid.
-Going on a raid?

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.320
Not a real raid.
It's kind of a mini-raid.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.400
A slave has escaped, so we
have to find him and bring him back.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.440
So that date we set up ages ago

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.160
to share a horn of mead
with Ansgar and Lone

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.880
to discuss odes and poetry
suddenly isn't important anymore?

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.400
-Was that today?
-Yeah, that was today.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.640
So you can just forget about
this sword fight or whatever it is.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.720
But Chieftain Olav needs me.
You need me.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.520
Olav, seriously?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.400
Look me in the eye and tell me you can't
find one puny little slave without Arvid.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.720
Of course we can.
Of course we can. No problem.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.720
But Ansgar and Lone are the lamest
couple ever. I don't even know them!

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.440
That's kind of the point. That you
get to know some of my friends

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.640
so we can find some couples
to hang out with.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.680
This is actually quite important.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.400
Finding couples to hang out with
is important!

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.680
To do something social together.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.640
And now you're going to mope

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.880
and you're the one who
broke the agreement!

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.640
[panting]

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.160
We found his tracks!
He's heading north through the forest!

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.120
From below the dragon

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.200
dark comes forth,

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.680
Nithhogg flying
from Nithafjoll;

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.720
The bodies of men
on his wings he bears,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.840
The serpent bright:
but now

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.160
must I sink.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.360
Look, goose bumps.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.920
That was lovely, Orm.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.280
That was so powerful.
I'm totally spent.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.240
Cheers, everyone.
So glad you could all make it.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.280
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.320
Everyone was supposed to
bring a poem special to them.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.440
So, maybe Arvid you can read yours?
Do you have a poem dear to your heart?

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.400
I don't know that many poems,
but I have written one myself.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.240
-Oh, good, good, good!
-I don't know if it's any good.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.800
-Don't sell yourself short.
-We're looking forward to this, Arvid.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.240
I'll bet there's a real poet
hidden under that rough surface.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.480
[chuckles]

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.920
Give us some poetic fodder
to chew on, Arvid.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.800
Show us there's something going on
inside that warrior skull of yours.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.920
[chuckling]

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.480
-Here goes.
-When you're ready.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.680
One, two, three

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.000
Take out your wee-wee

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.720
Four, five
Grab your bride

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.520
Six, seven, eight

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.160
Open up her gate

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.920
I think maybe I'll just stop you there.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.480
Nine, ten

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.240
Fuck her then!

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.120
Help!

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.520
Help!

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.160
I've been held captive by barbarians
on the other side of the mountain.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.280
You wouldn't believe what kind
of people they are. They keep slaves!

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.320
-Really?
-Yes.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.000
And not just me.
There are many.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.240
-The sanitary conditions are terrible.
-You are safe here.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.400
Thank you.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.600
Come with me. I'll get you
some warm food and a nice bed.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.760
...on men's lives.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.320
The wound-sea roared
on the headland of swords.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.280
The flood of barbs fell down
on the shore of Stord.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.520
That's lovely.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.080
That's what I call true poetry, Arvid.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
Arvid, what do you think he means,
when he says:

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.280
"Wound-fires burned in bloody sores"?

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:50.000
He probably means what he says.
Isn't that usually the way it works?

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.680
It's more what it doesn't say.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.160
You have to read between the lines.
That's why we're here. To interpret.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.920
So what do you think?

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.720
It's almost funny how little
is going on inside that massive head.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.520
Anyone home?

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.880
Anyone home?

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.320
Just messing with you.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.720
Seriously?
What is this?

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.520
What kind of people trick people
in distress into more distress?

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.520
Oh, great Odin, accept

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.480
our offer!

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.360
Hang on!

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.840
You're being pretty reckless
with that torch.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.920
Quiet!

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.040
I'm standing on flammable material.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.600
You will burn for a worthy cause.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.400
Wait, wait, wait!

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.280
You can't burn an artist.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.720
I'm valuable.
I can act.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.880
-Never heard of it.
-Never heard of acting?

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.960
No.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.440
It happens to be
one of the noblest of stage arts.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.480
Wait!

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.040
Pantomime?

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.080
Magic?
You must have heard of magic.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.280
Now we are excited.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.800
A real magician.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.320
Show us what you've got.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.320
Nothing unusual
with these hands, right?

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.720
What if I magically pulled off
one of my thumbs?

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.880
You can't do that. It's impossible.
Thumbs are stuck.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.760
He ripped his thumb off
and put it right back again!

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.360
And he's not even bleeding!

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.640
Now he's climbing up an imaginary wall.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.800
He's peeking out of a wall made of air.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.000
He's peeking

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.760
out from a wall of air!

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.040
[gasps]

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.840
He's pulling himself
with an imaginary rope.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.280
He's climbing an imaginary rope!

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.240
-It's a rope?
-Yes.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.560
This is great magic.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.680
He's climbing up a wall.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.600
He opens...

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.800
Yeah!

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.600
He's leaning himself on the air.
See that?

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.560
Very good.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.200
This slave of ours is much
more valuable than we thought.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.440
He's taking a look outside a door...

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.800
What is he building up to now?

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.840
Who are you?

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.960
[coughing]

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.400
-What do you want?
-You have something that belongs to me.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.080
FrÃ¸ya, we're actually in control here, so.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.040
Have you ever heard of
the man who had too much control?

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.440
No.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.440
No?

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.760
OK.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.000
Where was I?

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.560
-You have something that belongs to me.
-What?

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.960
That.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.440
Normally,

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.280
I would kill all of you.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.440
But you, my good man, managed to
bring forth great magic

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.160
in something I thought was a normal slave.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.480
So I'll just do like this.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.000
Do you hear me?

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.040
Never steal from Chieftain Olav.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.760
Hey!

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.560
Here you go.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.760
Jump.
Jump!

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.840
So said at least one nobleman
who never cursed the devil!

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.320
Maybe that one was easier.
So what was that about, Arvid?

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.600
It's basic, Arvid. Come on.
Coo-coo!

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.400
He didn't get this one either.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.200
Anyone home?

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.520
What in Loki's name
do you think you're doing?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.120
You don't go out that door, Arvid!
You apologize now!

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.400
I think the best thing to do
is to apologize, Arvid.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.600
We can't have a couples' party
on New Year's Eve

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.920
if you keep punching ladies
in the face, Arvid!

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:15.800
-Hey. You're just a tiny bit late, Arvid.
-I had to finish that poetry thing.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.760
Yeah, was it fun?
Did you... enjoy yourself?

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.960
You know about relationships.
It's about give and take. So...

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.480
Hanging out with other couples
is important, so...

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.200
You have to prioritize.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.080
Yeah, and you had to give
a little extra today.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.760
Arvid, we discussed it,
and what happened earlier there...

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.680
It's really not OK.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.800
No, but in a relationship it's important

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.360
to respect
that one has different interests.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.200
And this time Liv's interests
were more important than mine.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.600
You mustn't lose yourself
in the relationship.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.280
-No, of course. No, no.
-That's rule number one.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.960
No.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.280
Mutual respect, I think,
is rule number one.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.040
And I feel I have a lot of that.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.760
Liv?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.640
Liv?

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.600
I think the door might have jammed.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.960
[banging]

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.880
I'm sorry about Lone.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:35.160
It shouldn't have happened, but it did.
And I take full responsibility for it.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.920
Liv?

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.760
Hey, hey, hey!

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.680
Hey, kid. Hi!

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.360
Hi. Come over here.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.920
Are you out playing?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.880
Yeah?
You wanna play a game with me?

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.200
Have you ever heard of a game
called "dig out the body"?

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.680
You see that shovel behind you?

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.160
By the tree? Go get that shovel,
and I'll show you something really fun.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.840
That's a good boy!

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.720
Now take that shovel,
and carefully dig around my head.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.160
It's a little bit uncomfortable for me
to be buried like this.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.080
Ow!
What are you doing?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160
You son of a whore!

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.360
Don't!
No, don't do it!

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.800
You're gonna regret it! Ow.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.120
Water! 

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.040
I need water!

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.880
Can I get some water, please?

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.120
Preferably with a slice of lemon.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.360
Lime could also work.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.680
And if that's not OK... 

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.000
Regular water would be fine, I guess. 

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.840
[clears throat]

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.400
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.800
I am Orm.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.920
I'm the chieftain's brother.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.320
OK.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.760
I'm first in heir to the throne, so...

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.640
you could probably say
I'm a sort of a bigwig,

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.000
if you have to put
a label on it.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.560
Maybe you can get me out of here then?

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.960
That's not entirely impossible.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.840
But rumor has it
you have some sort of amazing

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.600
gift, bordering on magic.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.080
-I'm very curious.
-The thumb trick and the pantomime?

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.760
Yes, yes, people said
it was a magical performance.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.800
Those are just simple tricks
to please children.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.800
I'm actually an actor.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.680
A fabulous actor, by the way.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.200
Actor?
What is an actor?

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.360
You pretend to be
a different person than you are,

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.640
-in order to tell some sort of story?
-Yes.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.720
That's incredible!

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.240
Where I come from, that's where
the power lies. In the arts.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.480
Art can topple emperors
and make people filthy rich.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.440
That is exciting.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.720
You should have seen me.
The life I had.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.920
Yeah.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.520
The wealth. The food.
Orgies every day.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.240
-Orgies?
-Yeah.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.160
Naked, oily women and men,
like tangled together

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.560
in every position possible.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.640
-Both men and women together?
-Yeah.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720
Same gender?

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.000
-Both men and women.
-Both genders?

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.120
Both yeah.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.920
If you grab the one next to you,
and it's a man, that's OK?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.280
Everything is legal.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.360
That should be possible to have
that up here, in the North as well.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.760
Well, yeah, I don't see why not?

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.880
You and I have so much to talk about.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.920
I feel that we have this sort of...

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.160
-Chemistry.
-No.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.960
No, it's more like a contact.
We have this...

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.360
That's called chemistry.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.920
It's a connection. It's a connection
that we have. Lots in common.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.720
I think the word you're looking
for is chemistry.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.240
No, no, no.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.280
It's more like
there's something deeper.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.080
It's like another layer.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.640
We understand each other without
really having to say something.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.640
Yeah, and that's called chemistry!

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.040
[crackling]

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.080
Hello?

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.480
Hello, is anyone there?

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.440
[crackling]

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.160
Orm, is that you
sneaking around here again?

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.240
You received strict orders

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.240
not to sneak around the shitting log.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.520
Orm, I thought we agreed on this.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.040
There have been
too many negative reactions.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.720
People find this very unpleasant.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.640
Nice to see you again.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.400
[stabbing]
