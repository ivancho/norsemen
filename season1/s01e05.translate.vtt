WEBVTT

1
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.240
Then we will be back in Norheim.
We cheer for that.

2
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.000
Hoi!

3
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.400
We have become a welded bunch,
and it is quite delicious. Right?

4
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.960
Some may have noticed that we were heading west, but Earl Varg must not know.

5
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.560
-So if anyone asks, say East.
-Pardon!

6
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.600
Lying, somehow? It's stressful
to be entangled in a web of lies.

7
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.880
Right ...
But do you know what blood eagles are?

8
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.560
The back is cut up,
the ribs cut over and folded out -

9
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.800
- like the wings of a bird,
  and then the lungs are pulled out.

10
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.920
Those who say anything about it
that we went west, they get blood eagles.

11
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.280
-Can I say that to the brother, then?
- No, not for your brother.

12
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.680
Can I say that to my cousin?
He is very trusting.

13
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.680
No, not to your cousin either.
Other questions?

14
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.920
Ship!

15
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.960
Ship!

16
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.840
They come!

17
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.480
Ouch!

18
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.200
Look at him there, then!
Did you start with the costumes?

19
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.320
-You're shaking, yes. Is everything OK?
-Yes. Everything goes according to plan.

20
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.880
But look here. Taxes.
And gold coins ...

21
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.800
This is the most successful cruise in the village's history.

22
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.600
I was pretty clear that we
needed metal for installation.

23
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.600
Haven't you stolen any metal?

24
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.320
There are some silver mugs and cutlery ...

25
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.000
We can then get a lot of metal.

26
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.680
This was our very last trip,
and we will now become the capital of culture.

27
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.560
To get to the finish -

28
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.200
- must all ring bows, axes
  and swords are put in the cart here!

29
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.320
We live in the Viking Age, like.
Armed conflict is part of the thing.

30
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.040
-What if someone attacks us?
-Who's going to attack a village--

31
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.920
 - with the country's best summer game
   and who has an installation?

32
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.640
So, Arvid ...
Think a little, then.

33
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.560
Up in the cart!
All weapons! One after another!

34
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.080
Take off the ring bridge and come back.

35
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.560
-This is totally ...
-Now we're talking.

36
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.160
Do you have more at home,
so come down with it!

37
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.200
-You can carry. You have to lift ...
- Should I wear?

38
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.760
(He knocks at the table.)

39
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.520
I want to bring out
tonight's first dish -

40
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.160
- for the most amazing cruise of all time!

41
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.240
And for Rufus, who has
a phenomenal effort! Toast!

42
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.040
Toast!

43
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.640
Yes ...

44
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.080
Are you also gira on this one
the installation and the game and stuff?

45
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.320
Yes, it will be a real boost.

46
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.320
It's insane, after all. No weapons.
I've never been so insecure before.

47
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.000
Orm is not enough.
Very least to be the chief.

48
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.120
-And here you enjoy yourself?
-Yes ... Yes.

49
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.200
-What are you talking about, then?
- Nothing special. Marks about the cruise ...

50
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.480
Did I think I heard talk about me?

51
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.080
-No, we didn't talk about you.
-And the disarmament?

52
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.520
-We've collected everything.
-So good. Well done.

53
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.520
Yes Yes Yes ...

54
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.920
Totally agree! Manneperineum is prohibited
fruit, but it makes it exciting!

55
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.680
No but ...
Isn't it Earl Varg's men, then?

56
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.440
Welcome here.
The well-being of the guards.

57
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.640
Don't just stand there.
Meet and feed the fine people!

58
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.680
Here was a good atmosphere.
What is the cause of the party?

59
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.480
Party and party. There is more
a kind of gathering.

60
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.600
Now we celebrate homecoming
from the countries to the east -

61
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.080
- with a very lean yield,
  unfortunately.

62
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.640
-Yes, you have the earl's part ready?
-Yes, yeah.

63
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.280
-Do you see any new slaves?
-Yes. Yes.

64
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.640
-Is it okay if I take a look?
-Yes. Yes, yes.

65
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.400
Should only fail.

66
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.560
-Is there a new type of slave in the East?
-No. No.

67
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:39.200
Don't have the more box-shaped faces?
And tight-fitting eyes? Crooked noses?

68
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.760
No, it was before that.
Now these are typical eastern people.

69
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.640
Straight out from the East. Yes.

70
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.120
They are extremely east-facing.
Almost a cinema.

71
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.920
-Not Chinese.
-That's why the scholars argue.

72
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.520
No. These are not from China.

73
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:22.640
We come from the West.
They robbed us of Britannia.

74
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.800
Over the sea to the west.

75
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.920
East.
Robbed from the east, he says.

76
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:35.640
Red hair and talking something weird,
a language I've never heard before.

77
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.160
No, there is so much language at the moment.
And what does slaves talk about now? Trelsk?

78
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.000
No, then.

79
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:21.280
Don't get bored with those slaves,
be a little soft and get a little soft.

80
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:29.880
Meet, yes. Mead is not just mead
anymore. There are many varieties.

81
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.280
Yes, totally agree.

82
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.920
Complex.
Powerful. Tastefully.

83
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:47.360
Well balanced with a bit of smoke -

84
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.760
- in both taste and aroma.

85
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.280
We enjoy ourselves now.
And then we forget all the suspicion -

86
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.200
- about who went on the cruise in it
  one or the other direction. Toast!

87
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.280
Toast!

88
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.200
-And you're sober enough to ride?
-Yes I am.

89
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:36.120
Greet Earl Varg and say sorry for that
the prey was a little small, but the east ...

90
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.760
Morn again!

91
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.120
I was forgetting one thing, me.

92
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.840
I'll bring you
one of your red-haired slaves.

93
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.040
They look a little fun.

94
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.320
We hope the Earl doesn't find out
where that slave comes from.

95
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.760
-How's he gonna figure it out?
-If someone understands the language, then.

96
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.000
-He doesn't, does he?
- Don't hope so.

97
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.920
No.
Here it is important to think positively.

98
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.640
Nine out of ten concerns are unfounded,
don't they say that?

99
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.440
-Who says that?
-No of ten worries ...

100
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:50.000
-Yeah, but who says that?
-The. I don't have a name. But many.

101
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.800
-Never heard.
-No, but it's like that.

102
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.400
(He hums a sad tune.)

103
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.640
Please ...

104
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.240
Please, Earl Varg ...

105
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:32.600
I don't know how to
going west. I do not know ...

106
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.320
It goes well ...

107
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.600
(It knocks.)

108
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:05.240
That's right as we thought.
The Norheim people have been on a cruise.

109
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.360
That's all the prey.

110
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.560
-Buttons?
- Probably just to spread out a little.

111
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:39.440
But they brought some with them
quite exotic slaves as well.

112
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.080
Nice teeth.

113
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.520
His hair is red like fire.

114
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:05.560
He has dots on his face.
Quaint. RÃ¸dtopp.

115
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:13.120
Our Father, you who are in heaven,
hallowed be thy name ...

116
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.600
-Do you understand what he's saying?
-Yes.

117
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.280
Ask where he comes from.

118
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.040
-Where are you from?
-England.

119
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:35.760
He comes from England.
From a country to the west.

120
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.080
Norheim must be crushed.

121
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:56.280
Lord Tor, I'm looking forward to it.
There is something about men who want something.

122
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.400
It does something to me.

123
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.120
Unna. Give way.

124
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.000
Dear subjects!
The day has come.

125
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.000
We shouldn't just
unveil an installation, -

126
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.440
- but we will unveil a new age!

127
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.920
-It is allowed to hay.
- Hi ...

128
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:31.400
I'm at least as excited as you,
so here's the installation!

129
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.760
Is it a big weapon like that?

130
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.560
Guns?
No, this is art.

131
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.520
And art is maybe
the most powerful weapon.

132
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.840
-Okay, so it's a weapon?
-No. Not directly.

133
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:06.120
-How are we going to win the battle then?
- With emotion.

134
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.320
-What do you think?
-Ræva!

135
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.440
It is good!
I have triggered some emotions.

136
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.920
Art should provoke and challenge,
create debate and disgust.

137
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.680
But we must not censor
to taste and please.

138
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.840
Yes?

139
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:33.040
I think we struggle a bit with realizing
the point of the installation.

140
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:39.240
So the installation
is a kind of signal building.

141
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.480
-And then it shows ...
-It shows cultural strength!

142
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.440
And it puts us on the map.
And that ...

143
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:57.600
It is not the artist's privilege
to have to explain his art. Saw it.

144
00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.640
Tomorrow the tests will start
at the summer game, -

145
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:07.480
- get a good night's sleep,
  so you're ready!

146
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.640
I demand that.
Thanks. Float yourselves.

147
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.320
Orm ...

148
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.880
Jarl Varg?
I'm back from Norheim.

149
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.880
It seems like they have total shortage
on focus. Not a guard to watch.

150
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.640
Perfect. What are we waiting for? It will be
like stealing cattle from bitches.

151
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.520
Funny ...

152
00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.960
The rot on root.
The rot on the root ...

153
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.680
Arvid!

154
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.160
Are you asleep yet? Lord Tor,
it's the important day, yes.

155
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:15.680
See what Orm has sent. costumes
for today's tests. This becomes magical.

156
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.400
Wrap up, then.
Don't just lie there and be supportive.

157
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.000
What's this?

158
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.600
Just because it is not
an ax or a sword?

159
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.160
But why did I get it?

160
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:44.760
After all, you've been hand picked
for a role in the game! What an honor.

161
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.640
Little wonder that they have faith in you.
They see something no one else sees.

162
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.680
Loke, ass.

163
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.640
Okay guys then we are
finally starting the tests.

164
00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:22.640
So now everyone has to pull the load together,
then we put Norheim on the theater map.

165
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.560
Chief Orm has that clear
starred: Prince's mother.

166
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.920
Arvid plays the Prince's sister,
Othella.

167
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.280
And Kark plays their maid.

168
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.440
-We cheer for them, guys.
-Hi ...

169
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.400
You're welcome.

170
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.800
Oh, Knights of the West,
what about you?

171
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.960
We are just some simple peasant girls
who has lost us in the castle.

172
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:12.360
-Save our lives, because we are virgins.
- At that we can all swear.

173
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.080
-Save your life ...
-No.

174
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.920
-Your next reply.
-What?

175
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:29.520
It's just so unnecessary
to sabotage, Arvid. Look at Orm.

176
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.640
He has never played theater,
but blows me off the track.

177
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.760
And Kark, absolutely incomparable.
So expressive in replica and mimicry.

178
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.280
Thanks. The first time I have been praised.

179
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.080
If a sub human like Kark
if you can, so can you.

180
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.960
I'm scared by yours
lack of intellectual capacity.

181
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.480
-And then you're ugly too.
-What?

182
00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:02.040
Not to be cocky,
but it is important to get out all the rubbish.

183
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.720
Like that. Okay.
Then we take it from the beginning.

184
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.760
Oh, Knights of the West,
what about you?

185
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.640
What are they doing?

186
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:28.760
Three pretty women are present.
I get Sodom and Gomorrah vibes.

187
00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:36.200
Don't let the ladies distract us.
We have to find Orm.

188
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.840
Then we cut him off
tiny little bits until he dauer.

189
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.680
I have this little knife
just for that purpose.

190
00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.560
Don't stand ... Arvid.

191
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:55.680
There are soldiers. You have to defend ...
Look at Orm. Defend yourself. You are afraid.

192
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.760
You're being attacked because ...

193
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.080
We are being attacked!

194
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.360
It was a little too much ...

195
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:08.040
Lord Odin my creator, that
is Earl Varg himself. So powerful.

196
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.480
There are real men, that.

197
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:25.160
Hi. There it wakes up
acorn. I've got dumbbells, me.

198
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.960
Women to the guild hall,
and men in the cage.

199
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:51.240
I hope you are happy with yourself.
Not a weapon to power. Good work.

200
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.360
This is not the time
to cultivate disagreement.

201
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:59.280
It is honorable
to protect his chief.

202
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.280
Where is he miserable Chief Orm?

203
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.800
Then there is violation on the agenda!

204
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.760
But where to start?

205
00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.960
Lets see ...

206
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.040
Oh ...

207
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.160
Firm and nice.
Lord Tor ...

208
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.600
No wonder there are rumors
about the women in Norheim.

209
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.720
Grace! Grace!

210
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.760
Help ... Help me! Grace!

211
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.280
Where's Orm?

212
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:45.240
Look. "Pretend to whisper,
and then spit in the "trick" trick.

213
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.320
It's really good.

214
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.640
We have to get out of here
before they hurt us to death.

215
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:26.880
This is the plan: You distract
The guard, I kill him, then we go.

216
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Good plan. We could have used it
pot hatch, but you're the Viking ...

217
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:37.280
-Potty hatch?
- The hatch that goes straight out into the woods.

218
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.640
-Potty hatch.
-Okay.

219
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.800
(They hear groaning.)

220
00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:01.040
What about Orm?
He really gets to drive in there.

221
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:11.200
Any more who will sacrifice anything for Orm?
A finger, maybe?

222
00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.680
I'm not sacrificing anything
for that guy there.

223
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.880
Orm is in the guild hall.
In women's clothing.

224
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.280
Come on, come on ...

225
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.080
Yes, come on!
We have to hurry.

226
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.280
But we must bring with us
map to the west. In the coffin?

227
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.600
I can get it ... It is
actually a very private coffin.

228
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.160
It's not the map ...

229
00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:04.080
-What is it about?
-Do not look. Just something someone has added ...

230
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.280
A tent plug.

231
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.320
Is it illegal to have tent plugs here?

232
00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.920
O Orm!

233
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:36.120
-Here it is.
- Put it in the trash there. Safest.

234
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.240
Ssss ...

235
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.400
What is the sound you make?

236
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.440
Ormelyd.
Because his name is Orm.

237
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.920
Come on.
Quick!
