WEBVTT

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.840
Listen up, folks!
New guys, can I have your ...

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.760
Before you say anything,
let me alert you to the fact

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.040
that we haven't been served water
for over 12 hours. That's ridiculous.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.640
You'll get water afterwards.
First some practical information.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.720
Thank you.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.040
We'll be arriving home shortly.
That will be a new experience for you.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.720
None of you have ever
been to Norway before.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.600
You have?

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.840
No, I haven't been here.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.240
But I have relatives up here,
so I know the language.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.280
That's lucky.
So we understand each other, then.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.200
Yes, I happen to have an extremely
good ear for languages.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.240
-Like top class. World class.
-That's amazing.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.400
Well, it's time for the ættestup.
Anyone want to go first?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.440
Bjørn, you're the oldest.
Maybe you should take the first jump.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.280
Well, if someone else wants to jump,
it's OK for me.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.160
Anyone else have the urge?

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.600
-No, no.
-No, it's fine. Go ahead.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.280
OK, fine.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.520
If no one wants to jump, I can go.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.640
It's a matter of honor, isn't it?

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.640
The ættestup is
the most honorable thing you can do.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.120
Honor is really important, Bjørn.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.120
Could you move a bit back there,
give Bjørn some space?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.080
See you on the other side.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.960
See you.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.000
To Valhalla!

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.920
[thud]

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.120
Wow.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.520
Well, anyway, you can expect
to work hard up here.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.920
But you'll have a chance to learn some
new things and have some fun too.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.280
And I can almost guarantee
that you'll make some new friends.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.360
Excuse me?

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.920
-Yes, question?
-What's the pay like? Is it good?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.040
[laughter]

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.800
-It's not paid.
-We won't get paid?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.440
Not to complain, but I think the flow
of information here on this boat

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.240
is extremely arbitrary.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.320
And that's totally uncalled for,
when we're so crammed together

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400
in such a small craft.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.000
I didn't know until yesterday
that we were even going to Norway.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.440
So you think the information flow
is under par?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.720
Yes.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.320
-So here's some information for you.
-Finally!

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.160
Ow, ow!

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.040
Did you see that?
Did everyone see that?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.440
There's something
seriously wrong with my nose!

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.880
-Was that a bit too much?
-No, you're the chieftain.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.880
Aren't you supposed to be a little
like that when you're in charge?

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.960
But it's not really me, that
fear-based leadership style stuff.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.520
It doesn't feel right.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.600
Can you be my witness?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.560
Oddvar, maybe you want to go next?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.440
I'm thinking, what's the worst thing
that could happen -

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.960
- if I don't do the ættestup?

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.480
I mean,
what's worse than being crushed?

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.280
I don't know. I was just ordered
to take you up here. I mean,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.760
you're supposed to do the jump
and spare your families

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.880
the burden that is supporting
you in your old age.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.120
Yeah, but I'm only 47. It's...

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.080
I mean, it's not that old.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.760
I'm just going to skip
the whole thing.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.720
--OK?
-Yeah.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.080
I'm not going to jump either.
This is not my kind of thing.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.880
Anyone else want to jump?

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.560
-Come on, fellas. I mean ...
-It's just not very tempting.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.320
OK. I mean, I'm just a slave.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.080
I can't make you do anything
you don't want to do. But, uh...

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.160
Could you just please stay away
from Norheim?

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.520
So people don't understand
that you didn't do the ættestup?

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.320
Of course, no problem.
You'll never see us again.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.160
Great. Thank you.
Wonderful.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.960
OK, bye!

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.680
Can't exactly say I'm looking
forward to coming home now.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.280
No?

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.720
My focus has always been on pillaging
and ravaging and things like that.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.200
When all the other guys have settled down
with wives, kids, farms and stuff.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.040
I'm feeling kind of alone here.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.160
Yeah, but isn't that OK, too?

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.280
Do as you please.
Do whatever you want.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.680
Without having to plan it
three full moons ahead.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.720
I live in a tent. The only clothes
I have are the ones I'm wearing.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.880
I'm starting to feel
a little pathetic here

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.400
We have to do something about that.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.160
A good man like you shouldn't
be alone if you don't want to.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.680
You have so much to offer!

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.680
No, not that much.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.720
-I think I have a plan for that.
-Really?

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.920
A plan so crazy it might just work.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.040
Wow!

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.080
[chuckles]

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.920
Oh, it's you.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.160
How did it go?

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.480
You'll never see those guys again,
so I would say it went great.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.760
Good, good.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.880
Orm?

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.920
What is this?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.600
-Hm?
-So the rumors are true?

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.480
That you sent the old people
in the village to their death?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.760
Well, they took the ættestup.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.720
You finally got the chance
to run this village, Orm.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.920
And the result is people are forced
to throw themselves to their death

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.760
because we don't have any food?

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.720
What kind of leadership is that?
Are you pleased with yourself?

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.560
I think things are starting
to fall into place.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.480
-Well I don't.
-Well, then we have to agree to disagree.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.160
Which is something
I've decided to start saying.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.600
Chieftain Olav and his men should
have been home

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.280
from their raid
over a month ago.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.760
It's very strange that you haven't
done anything to get them home.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.640
No, but all that stuff is up
to Odin and the gods to decide.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.160
I mean, what am
I supposed to do?

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.200
You could at least have
sacrificed some slaves.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.280
Tried to be a little resourceful.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.560
Sacrifice? No, no, no,
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.760
All that screaming

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.360
and commotion...

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.800
Your wife is also on that ship.
You must be sick with worry.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.560
No, yes, I am very sick with worry.
For Frøya.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.680
You know, it would be incredibly
unfortunate if they didn't return home.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.000
I'd be left with permanent
responsibility here and everything.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.760
-Then you'd become chieftain.
-Yes.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.760
-Isn't that your big dream?
-No, no.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.080
I'm heir to the throne,
but it's not like

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.880
it's my dream.
No, I wouldn't say that.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.000
Okay, then we'll sacrifice
some slaves. OK?

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.080
No, I don't think so.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.200
That's pretty much what
people are calling for right now.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.560
Are they?

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.960
We're doing it, Orm.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.720
Yes, well then I will make
an executive decision, and say:

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.520
-That's what we'll do.
-Great. Come on.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.800
Odin, receive our second sacrifice! 

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.560
[chop]

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.440
[groans]

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.600
Odin, receive our third sacrifice!

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.160
Bring our men home!

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.760
-Wait, wait just a second.
-Yes?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.960
Not to cock up your plans or anything but,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.240
are you 100% certain that
it's necessary to sacrifice me?

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.240
Yes. I mean, ritual sacrifice
isn't a perfect science, but

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.480
I feel really confident
about this one.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.880
Okay, okay.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.360
I just ... you've sacrificed
two slaves already.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.560
You're not worried the gods are
gonna think that you're trying too hard?

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.800
That it's too much?

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.840
Mm, I really like the way you're thinking.
Don't get me wrong.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.680
I think it's great that you as a slave
bother getting involved.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.880
But if you don't mind,
I think we'll just move on.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.040
-Oh, okay, of course.
-Yes.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.240
I just thought I'd mention it.
No point in regretting it later. I mean...

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.200
Sacrifice isn't exactly reversible, but...
Okay.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.320
[laughs nervously]

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.680
A ship! 

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.040
They're coming! 

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.280
Shhh....

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.880
Thank you, Odin.
Thank you!

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.960
There you go.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.600
Two sacrifices was enough.
Should make a note of that.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.600
[laughter and commotion]

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.040
Hey, Frøya!

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.000
You can at least pretend to be happy
to see your husband.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.760
This is very embarrassing.
Kind of awkward.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.920
Holy Loki,
it's good to see you, brother!

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.520
Look at you, all tan!

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600
-Hi, Orm.
-Hi.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.400
So tell me! Where have you been?
What have you done?

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.320
Any good stories?
Any special moments?

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.200
Lots of special moments.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.520
It wouldn't be fair to all the other
moments if you should bring up just one.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.040
Because they were all so awesome.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.120
Oh, wow.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.040
From we got there till we left,

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.800
it was just a series of
one sweet moment after another.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.200
Lots of, you know, internal jokes and...
You wouldn't get it anyway.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.680
Next time I just have to join you.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.680
My back was a bit...
But it's much better now.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.120
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Much better.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.720
You should be really proud of your wife.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.720
Frøya dove into that pillaging 100%.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.680
Even took part
in quite a lot of the raping.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.120
Frøya forced all kinds of monks
to let her ride them.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.080
I didn't really expect that.
I was totally blown away

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.400
when I saw her on top of this monk,
moaning and groaning.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.880
Did you do that, Frøya?

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.520
Of course. I mean, that's what
you do when you pillage.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.200
That was kind of unnecessary,
wasn't it?

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.080
If it's unnecessary?
Well, yeah, maybe, but ...

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.720
If you joined a raid, you'd understand
how the world works. Yeah.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.800
Speaking of which,
are you going to the party tonight?

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.560
Yeah, sure, aren't we all?

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.480
How about pounding some down tepid
horns of mead at our place first?

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.040
Well, actually, all of us from the boat

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.720
kind of agreed to get together
before the party.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.120
Pour out some mead for our
dead comrades, reminisce and stuff.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.240
Reminisce? You just got
home a few moments ago.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.280
We're not going to reminisce about
the last moments on the boat,

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.560
we're gonna reminisce
about when we first got there.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.000
The first monastery we pillaged and stuff.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.920
I understand, but it couldn't hurt
if I was a fly on the wall, could it?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.960
You know, I can even bring my own chair.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.880
because you always say
there aren't enough seats.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.800
Yeah, yeah, mm.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.600
-I think It would get very crowded
-Yeah.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.520
if people start bringing
their own chairs, Orm.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.000
Yes, yes, no, but I understand.
But I can ...

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.680
I can, I can stand outside.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.080
You know, and just talk to the guys
who go to the toilet.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.960
And stuff like that,
that would be OK, wouldn't it?

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.040
I think maybe I heard someone say:

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.000
-"3-2-1, no one else can come."
-Yeah, that was Ragnar.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.600
That's not runed in stone, is it?

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.680
Stone or not stone,
you have to respect it.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.440
Or else it doesn't mean anything.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.960
You know, the whole rhyme
would lose its magic.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.320
It's going to be something
people just say.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.440
Oh?

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.920
But, Orm, you know what?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
We meet up in the great
hall afterwards.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.680
-Yeah.
-That's good. That's really good.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.680
-Afterwards?
-Yes.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.560
After...?

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.720
OK...

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.040
OK.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.840
Hello?
Just one thing.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.920
Yes?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.240
I had a cape with me on the ship.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.800
Er, er, it's more like a cloak, actually.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.440
Just without the buttons
all the way down. But anyway...

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.120
I gave it to one of your colleagues
who promised to return it.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.880
When we reached our destination.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.920
So, I don't know... maybe you
can ask around for me? Or?

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.240
-Nope. Come here.
-No?

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.720
Oh, there he is,
there he is! Hi.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.600
He's the one.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.640
I'm the one who lent you my cape.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.200
That's my cape.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.240
This is mine.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.360
-It's yours?
-Yeah.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.240
Well isn't that quite a coincidence,

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.080
if you and I happen use
the same tailor in Rome?

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.240
And have the same family crest?

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.800
I doubt that quite strongly.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.440
Well, that is the case.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.160
Come on, not even you can believe that.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.680
And you're wearing it all wrong.
It's getting dirty.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.080
You're wearing it like an amateur.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.440
-You don't like dirt?
-No. Who does?

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.640
[groans]

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.160
[strained grunt]

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.800
-Open your mouth.
-Excuse me?

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.920
Open your mouth.
Don't bite.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.120
-Whose cape is it?
-Yours.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.800
-It's my cape.
-Yes.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.200
[laughs]

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.720
Fast learner.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.280
You're not gonna get away with...

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.080
Hey, you! Hi.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.360
You're new, right?

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.880
We're gonna be strawmates.
Kark is my name.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.080
I was supposed to be sac...

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.760
[screaming]

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.840
I was supposed to be sacrificed today.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.400
But I got away, so they gave
me a branding instead,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.200
just so I wouldn't feel too lucky.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.000
OK?

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.800
-Isn't it amazing?
-No.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.680
I'm gonna show you where
we're gonna sleep. We're done, right?

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.520
Yeah, thanks, thanks.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.880
[chickens clucking]

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.920
Yeah, this is our spot.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.520
Nice and warm among the animals.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.880
-You're kidding, right?
-No.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.760
-I'm not sleeping in this pigsty!
-What do you mean? This is sweet.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.760
Sweet?

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.480
What...

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.240
What kind of place are those
goddamn inbreds running here?

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.640
Seriously, you're not going
to that pillage reunion, are you?

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.440
Well of course I am.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.520
Couldn't we take a mead here instead,

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.160
you know, just the two of us,
here, at home?

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.560
Uh, no.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.480
In Loki's name,
what's that around your neck?

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.240
Oh, this is a monk's necklace.
It's like a trophy I made.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.560
Is that ... a cock necklace?

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.640
Mm-hm.
From the monks.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.240
Are those monks giants?

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.160
These sizes are completely
out of proportion.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.760
Can you imagine, you know, getting hard

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.920
with a tool like that?
You'd be in trouble.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.520
Why?

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.280
Because you'd just drop to the floor.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.600
Your blood would go straight
from your head to your tool.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.960
You know, you would pass out completely.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.880
No, usually they don't.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.600
Actually this is quite a standard size,
I think.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.160
I have exactly the same tool.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.960
I think I know what a huge penis is.
Those are abnormal.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.280
Yes. I'm going to go now.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.280
I just feel sorry for those people who
have to walk around with dicks like that.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.360
Yes, I'm going.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.760
I feel sorry for them.
What a handicap!

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.920
Friends.
Brothers.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.280
Warriors.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.320
We're here to celebrate
that Odin guided us safely home!

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.680
-Skål!
-Skål!

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.440
We're also here to celebrate

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.920
that we found a way West.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.640
To a land that will see to it that we
will never again have a lean year.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.120
No matter how poorly
the substitute chieftain

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.200
manages the village while I'm away.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.040
It's time to celebrate!

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.000
Shame on those who don't get drunk!

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.520
Yes?

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.480
-Great party.
-Yeah.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.880
I think my assicle has fallen asleep.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.400
[grunts]

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.720
Those benches in there are so, so hard.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.120
They could at least
throw on a few animal skins.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.640
What do you mean?

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.080
The assicle falls asleep.
The assicle goes numb. Straight away.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.760
-Assicle?
-Assicle.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.440
You don't know what the assicle is?

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.920
-Nope.
-Assicle.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.720
That little thing that sticks out
between the penis and the hole?

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.840
On the... perineum?

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.720
That little thing that wags
when you're excited?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.640
What do you call it?

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.440
-I don't know.
-Well, I call it the assicle.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.680
I don't know if that's the right word, or
you know,

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.360
but I call it that,
I've always called it that.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.000
So that's how it's gonna stay.
OK, see you in there.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.760
Of course the horses
didn't see the difference

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.000
between coltsfoot and dandelion.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.920
[chuckles]

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.560
That was quite... peculiar.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.080
Olvar. Liv.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.560
"Milady."
That's how they greet

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.320
beautiful women in the West.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.120
Wow. Impressive.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.800
Welcome back from the raid.
I heard you pillaged well.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.360
Yeah, it was ...
It was really good.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.520
Was there something in particular
I could help you with?

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.680
Yes! Yes, there is one tiny...

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.160
question.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:51.000
-You still have that farm, don't you?
-I do. Biggest one in Norheim.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.240
And... it's still going very well?

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.280
Oh, it's going good!
[chuckles]

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.720
Yes, so that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.080
Because you know I dig you.
I always have and always will.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.520
And I really admire you
for what you have accomplished.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.320
Thank you, Arvid.
That's great.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.080
-Skål to Arvid!
-Skål!

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.400
So I thought I'd challenge you
to a holmgang.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.400
What?

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.440
Holmgang?! 

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.840
Yes. And then the winner
can take over the loser's

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.160
property and wife and stuff.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.760
Because that's how the rules are,

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.040
isn't it, Olav, Chieftain Olav?

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.680
That's right.
What you say there is right.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.880
But you don't own anything, Arvid!

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.840
But that's how the rules are.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.440
And it would be stupid of me
not to take advantage of it.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.760
But I built up everything

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.680
with my own hands, from nothing!

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.000
Yeah. And I really
respect you for that.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.320
But still...

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.920
I, Arvid, hereby

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.760
challenge Olvar to a holmgang!

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.080
[rooster crows]

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.040
[snoring]

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.360
Olvar?

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.560
Olvar?

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.000
Olvar? 

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.360
Olvar, are you sitting here hiding?

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.120
I'm not hiding, I'm just thinking.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.120
You can just forget about hiding.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.080
If you don't show up for the holmgang
you'll be deemed a niding. An outcast.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.000
You'll bring shame on me, indirectly.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.360
It's just that Arvid is so big.
I mean...

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:27.200
He has been trained to be a warrior
ever since he was a baby.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.960
And he has probably killed
a thousand men.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.520
I never touched a sword before today.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.240
Blah, blah.
Don't be so insanely defensive.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.240
You can beat him. It's all
in the mind. It's 99% attitude.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.560
-Is it?
-Sure.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.000
If you raise your game 5%,

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.600
and he lowers his 5%,
most of the job is done.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.600
Are the margins that

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.160
-small?
-Sure.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.840
If you also look at the possibility of
thinking a little outside the box,

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.520
anything could happen, right?

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.360
OK. Good luck.
See you there.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.880
Yeah. But, Liv, we...

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.040
-We go together.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.160
No, I'm just going
with some old friends.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.080
What? What friends?

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.160
"What? Who?"
Some old friends.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.880
OK.
Should I leave the door open?

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.920
Close it.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.440
Good luck!

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.920
Olvar.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.760
There you are.
That was in the nick of time.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.160
You wish to exchange coins for poison?

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.680
Exactly. I got myself messed up
in a holmgang over here.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.960
Give me your sword.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.720
Yeah.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.480
Don't send a sword over tip first.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.840
-Easy child's learning.
-Sorry.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.120
This is the deadliest poison
you can find.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.360
One scratch of his skin
and he'll be dead in seconds.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.360
OK.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.120
Thank you.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.160
I will be forever in debt to you.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.400
But you gave me money, so...

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.080
Yeah.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.480
It's a figure of speech, isn't it?

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.040
-Yeah, I guess.
-Yeah.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.560
Bye.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.560
Odin!

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.120
God of all warriors!

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.200
Today you will receive a new guest

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.240
in Valhalla!

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.080
Can I say something before we begin?

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.920
Yeah, that's fine.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.520
Olvar will say a few words!

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.760
Many of you,

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.080
perhaps most of you,

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.760
don't believe
I stand a chance here today.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.920
And to you I will say

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.480
this:

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.080
Little strokes

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.880
fell great oaks.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.600
That's it? Yeah?

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.880
Actually, I didn't get it, really.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.680
What I mean to say, Arvid,

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.720
is that you will regret

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.560
challenging me to this holmgang.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.800
This is the dumbest thing
you've ever done.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.480
Why do you say that? You have
a secret weapon or something?

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.160
This is the last thing
I will say to you:

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.280
The harder you come,
the harder you... fall.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.720
-Harder you...?
-Fall!

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.120
OK, lots of fine words.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.960
Now, let's get ready!

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.120
May the best man win.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.280
Three.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.800
Two. One.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.520
Holmgang! 

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.720
Yes!

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.920
Bull's-eye!

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.480
Estate owner!
Yeah!

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.240
Awesome!

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.360
It's you and me then.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.920
All right.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.560
Wow, you're so strong!

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.280
You think?

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.800
OK? Yes.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.960
Kiss me.
