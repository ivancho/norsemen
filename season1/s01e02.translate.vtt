00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.160
What are you doing ?!

2
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.560
I got it in me.

3
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.160
Shit Community!

4
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.360
Neimen ... It was then
scary to hum at you, then.

5
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.840
You must smile to the world.

6
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.800
I woke up to two dirty men
did its thing in my mouth.

7
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.280
- And I think I swallowed some of it.
-Number two?

8
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.360
-What? No!
-You probably have nothing to complain about.

9
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.200
Tiss from the source is completely sterile.
Doesn't taste so bland either.

10
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.320
Yes, it tastes delicious.

11
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.760
You learn to appreciate
on the little points gradually.

12
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.240
The Vikings are creative
in the area there.

13
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.960
Just take off your hat.

14
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.880
I don't take my hat off
to pee in the mouth.

15
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.320
No no. You can wear it, you.

16
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.960
No!

17
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.280
-No no ...
- Dirty whores!

18
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.440
- Staying down!
-No!

19
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.040
You killed my hubby!
Just penetrate me, but save the kids!

20
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.400
-I think I need to take a break.
-Break? Had we started?

21
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.680
-I need water or something.
-Okay. This is just gonna be stupid.

22
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.720
-Embarrassing!
-I think too much.

23
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.400
- Then I'll be stressed.
-Okay. Just get up.

24
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.520
The new farmer is unable to perform. Just hanging there like a snail.

25
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.200
I'm sorry. I'm starting to
Think too much. Then one forgets to feel.

26
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.200
Then you get stressed.

27
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.960
Here, everyone gives the iron for
to make a big show around you.

28
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.760
Then it's like
not good enough. What do we do then?

29
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.160
I just wanted to try
to get in the mood.

30
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.920
Your sexual experience
consists of rape and coercion.

31
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.360
- Why isn't this good enough?
- With them, it didn't matter.

32
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:13.880
But we are married and very
crush. I think you're so pretty.

33
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.280
That is why. I get performance anxiety because you are too pretty.

34
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.000
- It's cute, then. Do you think so?
-Yes.

35
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:34.000
Do you know what I think? I think so
is a fucking whistle. And that's only your fault.

36
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.280
You're not going down the arc
again. There's a lot to do here.

37
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.000
Arvid!

38
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.960
Imagine that -
my very last day as a slave.

39
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.800
For over 20 years I have been working and struggling.

40
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.280
But today, when I put the ax in
the tool shed, I am a free man.

41
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.640
-What are you planning to do?
-Yes, where do I start?

42
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.800
I want to take care of myself
all that life has to offer:

43
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.280
Traveling, sucking my impressions,
especially visual impressions.

44
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.320
-You've always been an aesthetic.
-I love watching.

45
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.080
Glane, look,
glowing, peeking, whey -

46
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.720
- believe, Scots,
  behold, behold, behold.

47
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.160
Monkeys, yes, generally take things into view.

48
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.120
Now I have learned
to read too, so these eyes -

49
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.400
- Jaggu will have to move forward.

50
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.520
Arvid.

51
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.000
-What's there for something?
- I don't see anything.

52
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.960
Two extremely pointed objects
comes rushing at tremendous speed.

53
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.640
You must learn how to communicate.

54
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.960
(A loud scream from the forest)

55
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.880
- It was arrows!
-In Lok's name!

56
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.520
- Can't you do anything?
- Don't take them out!

57
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.640
- They have barbs. I feel it.
- You can't possibly know that.

58
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.200
You can't walk around with
two arrows in the head for the rest of life.

59
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.360
Imagine having to sleep on your stomach.
It's not going to work. They have to get out.

60
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.760
Take it easy now. It is much
easier if you do not twist.

61
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.880
Ouch!

62
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.600
Trust us now.
I'm fine. Okay, at 3. 1, 2 and 3.

63
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.440
I see nothing.

64
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.640
Is that the point?
Was the operation successful?

65
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.920
Not at all.
It's absolutely awful.

66
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.640
-I can see far into your head.
- You were right about it with barbs.

67
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.960
You came straight from the forest now
all alone? No guards?

68
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.800
-No.
- Why didn't you quit?

69
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.720
Why should I leave?
I'm a volunteer here.

70
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.320
I was set free
in the mid 80's.

71
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.400
It felt completely wrong to me out there
on their own. Everything went so fast.

72
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.520
I like better
in fixed frames in here.

73
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.480
-You are institutionalized, that is.
-Yes, yeah.

74
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.040
Nothing is better than working
for others without getting paid.

75
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.920
- A lot of things are better than that.
-I strongly doubt that.

76
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.760
Just give this some time,
then you will love it.

77
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.760
Yes ...

78
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.800
Where's the slave
who is in charge of the grua?

79
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.960
It's insanely cold here!
I prefer everything tempered!

80
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.960
Go and find him right away.
This he must lose an ear for.

81
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.560
He is gone.

82
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.960
- We can't find him.
-Block the horn.

83
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.240
Ragnar, Frøya,
look for tracks on the north side.

84
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.400
Will, see if there is a boat missing.

85
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.520
Arvid, you stay here with me.
We'll find the miserable slave.

86
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.200
Arvid!

87
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.600
What are you imagining now?

88
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.000
- We're going on a cruise.
-Tokt?

89
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:26.680
Yes. Mini Cruise. It has escaped a slave
which we must find and bring back.

90
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.760
So the deal to take a couple
horns met with Ansgar and Lone -

91
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.920
- isn't that important anymore?
  It was today, that.

92
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.400
- There will be no fencing on you.
But Chief Olav needs me.

93
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.160
Seriously. You can find
a crap slave without Arvid.

94
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.000
Yes it's all right.

95
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:53.640
Ansgar and Lone are the deafest in the world.
I don't even know them.

96
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.320
That's one of the points - that you should
get to know some of my friends.

97
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.600
- But this is very important.
- Friends are important!

98
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.960
You have no plans to be angry
when you deal with breach of contract?

99
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.360
Then we have traces! He is
on the way north through the forest!

100
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:47.000
Get the dull dragon flying,
frog-snake, below from Nida-fjell.

101
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.160
Praying corpses in the feather room, flying overhead full.

102
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:59.600
Nidhogg pink.
Now they will search.

103
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.280
Look - goose bumps. It's so beautiful!

104
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.720
A real effort
to listen to. It's so strong.

105
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.640
Toast! Nice that everyone could come.

106
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.600
-Toast.
-Toast.

107
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.200
That everyone should
prepare a poem that means -

108
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:27.080
- something special to them. Maybe
  you can read your poem, Arvid?

109
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.800
I don't know so many poems,
but I have written one myself.

110
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.600
-So good!
-I don't know, but ...

111
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.560
-Don't sell yourself short.
- We're excited.

112
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.760
It is probably a real hiding place
poet beneath the rough exterior.

113
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:49.600
Give us something real
poetry to chew on now.

114
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.480
- Should I just start?
-Yes, drive on.

115
00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.320
One, two, three, pants down.

116
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.600
Four, five, the dick forward.

117
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.120
Six, seven, eight, into the cone.

118
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.240
I'll stop you there.

119
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.200
Nine ten. Then we pee.

120
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.920
Yes ...

121
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.920
Help.

122
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.960
Thank God.

123
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.200
I've been caught by barbarians
on the other side of the mountain.

124
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.000
What are you saying?

125
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.920
You will not believe what kind
people it is. They keep slaves.

126
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.840
Thank you, God, for finding you.
It's not just me. There are many.

127
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.080
Unworthy conditions. To say the least, the sanitary conditions ...

128
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.640
We'll get to the bottom of this.
Relax. You are absolutely safe here.

129
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.520
Take it easy.
Join me and we'll find ...

130
00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.240
The seashore buzzed about the sword.

131
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.280
Flein flood falls in the fjord on Stord.

132
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.440
That was nice.
There you have real poetry, Arvid.

133
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:47.640
 What do you think he means
"The fire of fire burned in bloody screams"?

134
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:59.560
I really think he means it
he says. That's what is common.

135
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.600
It might be more about what it is
not to say, that between the lines.

136
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.760
What do you think?

137
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.760
Almost amazing how small
takes place in the huge head there.

138
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.120
Is anybody home?

139
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.320
Is anybody home?

140
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:11.440
Seriously? What's happening? Whose
Do people in distress enter even more distress?

141
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:18.000
- What's the matter?
-Oh, great Odin. Receive our sacrifice.

142
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.040
Now you are
very reckless with that torch.

143
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.920
-Quiet! You're passionate about a good cause.
Wait!

144
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.280
You can't burn
an artist. I am valuable.

145
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.640
-I can play.
-Never heard of.

146
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:45.240
It is the best thing in the performing arts.
Pantomime, then? Not pantomime?

147
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.960
Enchantment, then?
You must have heard about that.

148
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:15.600
Yes, now we are excited. And real
sorcerer. See what you're good at.

149
00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.000
Nothing unusual
with those hands here?

150
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.960
What do you say if I went
of me the one thumbs up?

151
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:30.200
It doesn't work. It can't be done.
Thumbs stuck down.

152
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:44.080
He ripped his thumb off and set it
back space. It doesn't even bleed!

153
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:54.360
He walks along a wall of air.
Now he looks out from the air wall.

154
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.880
-He looks out from behind a wall of air.
-Yes.

155
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.840
Now he moves forward
in an imaginary rope.

156
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.840
He climbs in an imaginary rope.

157
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.800
-This is super magic.
-Yes.

158
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:29.680
He pulls down a hatch, I think.
Yes! Looking inside. Leaning in the hatch.

159
00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.040
He is much more valuable than we thought.

160
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.080
Opens a door.

161
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.600
What happens now?
Why does he just stand there?

162
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.200
What is it
is he building up now?

163
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.440
Who are you?

164
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.160
-What do you want?
-You have something that belongs to me.

165
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.520
We really have control here now.

166
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.680
Have you heard of the man
who had too much control?

167
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.040
-No?
-No.

168
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.480
Where was I?
Yes, you have something that belongs to me.

169
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.080
-What?
-That.

170
00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.160
Usually I would have killed you all.

171
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:44.480
But you have evoked great magic
in something I thought was an ordinary slave.

172
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.960
So we're just content with this here.

173
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.760
You hear me? Never ...
Never stole from Chief Olav.

174
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.160
Jump! Jump!

175
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.600
Yes, a noble man said so
like a silly scream about the chimney.

176
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.960
-Gorgeous!
-Yes.

177
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.920
Maybe it was a little simple.
Arvid, what is it about here?

178
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.680
It is very basic.
Come on. Peekaboo!

179
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:37.720
He didn't understand this either.
Is anybody home? Hello!

180
00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:46.040
What in Locke's name is what you run
with? Apologize in any case.

181
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:52.240
No New Year celebration with friends
if you box the ladies in the face!

182
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:05.440
Hello. You're just a little late.

183
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:11.040
-Was it fun? Do you enjoy yourself?
-That's the way things are.

184
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.880
It's all about giving and taking.

185
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.560
Friendships are important,
so one has to prioritize.

186
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.240
- So you had to give some?
-Frøya, it ...

187
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:29.240
Arvid, we're talking in town
about what happened.

188
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.960
It wasn't quite inside.

189
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:40.680
No, but in a couple relationship it is
It is important that you have different interests.

190
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.440
Now it was Liv's interests
more important than mine.

191
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:51.680
Don't lose yourself
in the relationship. It's Rule # 1.

192
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:57.960
Mutual respect
thought I was rule # 1.

193
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.200
I feel that I have plenty.

194
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.960
Life, I wonder
whether the door is jammed.

195
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.160
Life, come on, then!

196
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:36.720
Life, sorry about that with Lone. Sånt
should not happen. I lay flat.

197
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.520
Life, come on, then!

198
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:04.480
Hey Hey! Hey you! What a nice and
nice toddler you were. Outside and toys?

199
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.040
That's nice.
Want to play with me? So good.

200
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:14.880
Have you heard of a game like that
called "digging out the body"? No.

201
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.400
Take that shovel there and come here,
and I'll show you some fun.

202
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:27.160
There, yes. Very good. Then you take
and digging gently around my head.

203
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.600
It's a bit uncomfortable
for me to be buried.

204
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:36.640
Ouch! What are you doing,
the horn of hell?

205
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.320
No. Do not do it.
You will regret it.

206
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.440
Ouch!

207
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.240
Water! I need water!

208
00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:03.320
Can I have some water?
Certainly with a slice of lemon!

209
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.280
Possibly paste.

210
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.640
Normal water works well too.

211
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:29.720
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Orm, brother of the chieftain.

212
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.920
First in the succession,
so I'm kind of a big guy.

213
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.760
Can you get me out of here?
-It's not impossible.

214
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:45.080
Rumor says you have
any amazing skills?

215
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.160
- I'm very curious.
-Pantomime and thumbs-up.

216
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.520
People said
it was a magical performance.

217
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:59.280
Just simple tricks to please
children. I'm actually an actor.

218
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.360
What is it?

219
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.040
You pretend to be someone you
is not, to tell a story?

220
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.160
That is where the power lies
where I come from - in the arts.

221
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.760
Art can overthrow emperors
and make people wealthy.

222
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.280
You should have seen the life I had -
wealth, food, orgies every day.

223
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.680
-Orgier?
-Orgier, yes.

224
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.480
Men and women are entangled in each other
in the wormhole of naked bodies.

225
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:54.240
Totally naked? Both men
and women? Both genders?

226
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.320
-You just take the closest one?
- Everything was okay.

227
00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.280
Well, we could have
something like this in the north too?

228
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:09.480
-Yes, why not?
-We have a lot to talk about.

229
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.160
-I feel like we have a ...
-Chemistry.

230
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:21.440
No, there is more contact.
Relational. That we have a lot in common.

231
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.560
I believe the word
you are looking for is chemistry.

232
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:30.960
No, there's more
a deeper understanding of each other.

233
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.360
-Yes, it's chemistry.
-No.

234
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.640
Hello?

235
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.040
Hello, is anyone there?

236
00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.680
Orm, you're sneaking
around here again?

237
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:09.480
You have been told strictly
about not strolling around dostanga!

238
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:15.800
There have been too many negatives
reactions! This is very private.

239
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.640
Thanks for last.
