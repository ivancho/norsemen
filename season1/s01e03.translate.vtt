1
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.160
Spit in the jar, Hildur.

2
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.360
Anyone seeking answers,
must spit in the jar.

3
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.360
-Okay, I can probably spit some.
-You have to spit properly.

4
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.480
Oi!

5
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.760
You're wondering
whether your husband survives?

6
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.760
-Hi. How's this going?
- Yeah ...

7
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200
The ridge is the shape?

8
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.520
It's not about how you
have it, but how to take it.

9
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.240
Right? But it looks nice,
this here. How bad can it be?

10
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.240
Feel my heart, Arvid.

11
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.960
Know properly.

12
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.000
-It still feels strong?
-Yes, it feels just fine.

13
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.360
Just as a heart should feel
out if you touch it directly.

14
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.240
Here it was spilled.

15
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.960
I see fire.

16
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.720
Grunts and growls. Kneks and drops.

17
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.440
Does that mean he
going to live or die?

18
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.920
The gods are not clear
to receive him yet.

19
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.160
Now I was relieved. It was
really good news.

20
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.000
I've been so worried. He lies
there with visions on display.

21
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.960
If I die, Odin forbid,
I want you to become chief,

22
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.600
- not he Orm girl.

23
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.440
I? Chief? But Orm
is, after all, a second in line.

24
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.160
Will not be
very bad mood then?

25
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.840
Unfortunately, Orm is complete
unfit. This is my decision.

26
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.040
Tomorrow I tell
village what i have decided.

27
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.720
No.

28
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.880
Drink.

29
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.360
You must drink from the prophecy cup
whether the prophecy will come true.

30
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.400
How many have the saliva
up there before me?

31
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.920
I'm getting sick
if I drink the stuff there.

32
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.560
-That's how it works.
- But ...

33
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.440
Don't hate the player.
Hated the rules of the game.

34
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.960
I agree, but I do
must ask you something.

35
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.560
Is it you who is grieving
for the prophecies to come true?

36
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.280
It is not me who controls the future.
It's the gods. I am the intermediary.

37
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.840
If you have no influence, it is
no joke that I drink this.

38
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.320
-You can't chirp with fate.
-No no.

39
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.600
You have to drink.
Then the prophecy is fulfilled.

40
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.880
-But I got my answer.
- Can't you just drink?

41
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.200
It is not intended
to make your job difficult -

42
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.520
- but to drink saliva
  gets totally wrong for me.

43
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.040
Take the coffin.

44
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.160
-The map to the west?
-Yes.

45
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.120
Unfortunately, we can't keep it.

46
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:24.560
I promised Jarl Varg he would
get the map. This is important, Arvid.

47
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.280
Varg is
an erratic and ferocious type.

48
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.200
If he doesn't get the map,
we can quickly go for a bang.

49
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.720
Orm is here.

50
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.680
-Arvid.
-Orm.

51
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.720
I'm pretty tired now.
Can't even lift arms.

52
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.040
So much so?

53
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.600
So if I do that,
what do you feel then?

54
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.200
-Are you able to push against?
-No, I don't have a kang.

55
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.640
So weak
in arms and upper body, yes.

56
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.320
The neck too? You can
not to nod or bar?

57
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.360
Strange? No.

58
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.760
Hello.

59
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.600
Oh my.

60
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.800
-How are you?
-I do not know.

61
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.320
-We must have had better days.
-Yes.

62
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.560
-What about you?
-I do not know. I just ...

63
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.000
Let's get set
ours a little to Tor and Odin.

64
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.520
-The shaman seemed so positive.
- Did he?

65
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.160
Yes.

66
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:35.240
The sick thing is that if he doesn't
should survive, Olav said -

67
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.160
- that he wanted me to
  should take over as chief.

68
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.320
But I don't know if I am
correct the man for that job.

69
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:50.160
Yes. You would be
a fantastic chieftain.

70
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:56.360
You are so strong after all
and fair and warm.

71
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.320
You are really strong after all.

72
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.160
The chieftain is dead!

73
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.560
-He's dead in there!
-Olav is dead!

74
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.240
-The chieftain is dead!
-He's dead in there!

75
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.800
-Olav! Olav!
-Olav is dead.

76
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.040
Olav has left us.
It's awful. I am heartbroken.

77
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.920
-I should have been there.
- It happened very quickly.

78
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:40.960
The only sure thing is
that he died of natural causes.

79
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.720
He was told he wanted to
to take over as chief?

80
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:54.760
Yes. His last words were
that it was all a grotesque joke.

81
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.080
That was not my impression.

82
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.840
The one who only takes jokes
for joke and seriousness only serious, -

83
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.600
- have done both poorly.

84
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.880
-And here was the seriousness that was a joke.
- Now I fell a bit off the load.

85
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.840
I don't know if I can
accept it without further ado.

86
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.560
Everyone here knows that I do
is first in the succession order.

87
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.560
And if you have a problem with that,
then we have something called blood eagle.

88
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.320
Seriously? Is it like this
you have to deal with this?

89
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:40.200
It is exactly that
I have to deal with this.

90
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.400
(Orm hugs)

91
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:44.200
Odin, today you can cover the main hall
in Valhall with the finest tableware -

92
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.840
- and decorate with field flowers
  in all the colors of the rainbow -

93
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.760
- soon Olav is on his way.

94
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.680
Dear brother, if you
had been among us today, -

95
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:06.120
- would you give me a good hug
  and said you regretted that way -

96
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.680
- you've been treating me for years.

97
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.320
Then you would have fields
a tear as you thought -

98
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.240
- the times you shut down
  me out of play when we were kids -

99
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:27.560
- and party and fun in adulthood.
  But wipe the tears, Olav.

100
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.960
One thing is certain:
You had surely said -

101
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:39.960
- that the village is in the best
  hands with me as new chieftain.

102
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.560
Push off!

103
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.480
Bye, brother.

104
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.920
Bye, brother.

105
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.600
Don't you just let me do it?

106
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:31.600
No, I'm just a little cold
On the hands. The arrows are a little smooth.

107
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.640
This is too stupid.

108
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:45.120
It is important that you hit the raft,
otherwise he will not come to Valhall.

109
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.920
Come on. Give me that bow.

110
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.280
Let Arvid do it
before the fleet goes too far.

111
00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.320
No way.
That's my brother. I'll fix this.

112
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:07.240
-Come on! This is extremely important.
-No no no.

113
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.960
I'm trying one last arrow
to be completely sure.

114
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.400
It's too late.

115
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.480
Would Tor and Odin that I
had to hit, I had.

116
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:31.400
Who is it that bows the chieftain?
its now? Now I was really disappointed.

117
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:38.040
Someone has shot arrow
with properly frozen fingers before?

118
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.960
That's what I thought. The
is actually important. It has a lot to say.

119
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.240
Then you learned something today as well.
No need to hang with the beak.

120
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.000
Next weekend there is tomb beer.

121
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.400
Well met.

122
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:20.000
-A little late. The funeral was yesterday.
- We're not here for the funeral.

123
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.360
Rumor tells you
have been traveling west.

124
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.800
That is right.
And quite a successful cruise too.

125
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:32.720
Chief Olav swore on
that he would draw a map.

126
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.480
I haven't heard anything about it.

127
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.640
He probably shared it
the information with me.

128
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.920
There should be a map
among Olav's assets ...

129
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.320
Yes correct. We sent it
out with the funeral raft.

130
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.560
We thought we would send
all his dearest possessions.

131
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.880
-Seriously?
Serious as cancer.

132
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.600
-This is not what the Earl will like.
-No, but that's it.

133
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.040
The map is gone, and it is
nothing but very regrettable.

134
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.320
Yes, very sorry.

135
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:18.760
-Was that map really valuable?
-Yes, a very valuable map.

136
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.360
Extremely valuable.

137
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.480
Kark?

138
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.680
-You can calm down, right?
-Yes, I row like a Viking.

139
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.160
You're going out on a secret mission. You
will calm down and find Olav's tomb.

140
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.800
Don't come back
before you find the map.

141
00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:02.920
Well, well, well, Rufus of Rome.

142
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.720
I promised to see you again.

143
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:17.080
We had that contact.
We had such a special ...

144
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.760
-Chemistry.
- No, that's not what I was thinking.

145
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.880
But what you told
about plays and theater -

146
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.640
- gave a proper one
  great soundtrack in me.

147
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:39.200
To achieve such a cultural boost ... It
is the way I want to get here in Norheim.

148
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.680
To set up theater
is very resource intensive -

149
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:51.240
- in terms of human capital,
  creative and talented heads.

150
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:58.040
And one who has lots of experience
from theater. It is absolutely essential.

151
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:06.080
After all, I have. I
have lots of experience. And talent.

152
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:13.320
They say my talent is one of those
which comes once per generation.

153
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.920
I want to see
with your own eyes what you are good for.

154
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.680
I want you to make highlights
of your repertoire at the Guild tonight.

155
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.480
-I can do that.
-So good.

156
00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.680
And from under the veil rose
he sang and sang a song -

157
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.320
- about the mother of all creations.

158
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.120
Ten you've sung so vividly
and true to the fate of the Akha,

159
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:54.400
- about what they did and suffered,
  and what they had to die for.

160
00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:00.160
Folks, this is beautiful. It is
Odysseus talking to the bald.

161
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.440
It's art!

162
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.080
-So you guys liked it?
-Yes.

163
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:15.360
Your first piece
was absolutely amazing.

164
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.400
-Can I steal you a little?
-Yes of course.

165
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.320
-I can meet you outside.
-Yes.

166
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.560
-Have you read these runes?
-No.

167
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.520
But there are plenty
of them at dostanga.

168
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.200
-People sit and read and laugh at them.
-There are rune sticks about me.

169
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.880
These are pretty childish messages.
But now it will end.

170
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.440
Now I am chief, and I am
should put an end to this.

171
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.200
Do you need help?

172
00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:02.640
But apropos theater. I was incredible
impressed with what you did in there.

173
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:14.600
And I'm going to ask you
whether you want to be a theater man.

174
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.960
One who can
and has overall responsibility ...

175
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:25.200
-Do you mean creative leader?
-Yes, that's what I meant.

176
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.640
I don't know if you are
aware of who you are engaging with.

177
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.520
I am completely uncompromising
when it comes to art.

178
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:40.280
Should I put my signature on this,
I need free space.

179
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.640
But what do we do then?

180
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.240
The most obvious
is to make an installation.

181
00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.600
Good idea. We do. What is it?

182
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:57.400
It is a space-creating figure or
sculpture consisting of various objects.

183
00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:04.360
It is not important what it is made
of. The important thing is the symbol value.

184
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:12.800
-And what does it look like?
-I have an exciting vision.

185
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.040
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

186
00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.640
-Isn't that a grave beer?
- Yes, in a way.

187
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.440
It started a while ago.
And punctuality is a virtue.

188
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.320
We were sitting and drinking,
and then we had so much fun.

189
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.960
Vorspiel is often the nicest.

190
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.000
Once you get to the party,
everyone spreads for all wins.

191
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.560
Ten, ten, ten, ten ...

192
00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.480
This is a party
to honor your new chieftain,

193
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.400
- not an anecdote party about our-
  spiel's excellence versus party.

194
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.360
I thought this was it
a party to honor Olav's memory.

195
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.200
Should we not pour out mead
and mimes and laugh and cry?

196
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:34.480
If I as a deceased brother
have managed to move on and forget, -

197
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.160
- it is fair and reasonable
  that you can do it too.

198
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.200
Besides, it was the perfect one
reason for certain people -

199
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.440
- can promise allegiance
  to his new chief.

200
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.240
-What certain people?
- You, Arvid.

201
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.000
Unless you want to stay either
niding and banished from the village.

202
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:59.840
-Of course not.
- But so good. Gorgeous. Kiss your hand.

203
00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.400
Kiss your hand.

204
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.600
-Seriously?
- Kiss it.

205
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.920
Kneel.

206
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.000
Kiss.

207
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.720
Look there, yes. It wasn't that dangerous.

208
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.760
You have a new chief
and a new regime.

209
00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:34.200
Already tomorrow you will
Notice that things are different here.

210
00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.200
No! Not!

211
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.600
Orm! What are you doing?

212
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:59.320
Well, well, well. We haven't
the rune stick maker in person?

213
00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.480
I said, "Well, well, well. We haven't
the rune stick maker in person? "

214
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.520
None of you have nailed
rune sticks with message about me?

215
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:14.360
-It was not me. What does it say?
-It's not important.

216
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.920
Can the culprit confess
once, will we get it over with?

217
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:26.600
-Well, it's mine.
-Do you think this is innocent fun?

218
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.320
-It's humor.
- Is it humor to be punished as well?

219
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.120
Punishment for writing rune sticks?
Do we not have freedom of speech?

220
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.320
I disagree with what you say,
but I want to fight to the death -

221
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:44.000
- for your right to say so. But
  right here you crossed the line.

222
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:49.640
Hildur, it is proven that you
is the woman behind rune sticks -

223
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.560
- with the messages:
 "Orm is rassr-agr."

224
00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.800
That is, Orm is an immense,
gay, perverted person -

225
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.080
- and a despicable human being.

226
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.560
It's just such a total disc boom.
For humor to have relevance, -

227
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.800
- it must have root in reality.
  This is where you totally fail.

228
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.760
Okay you don't think it is
funny. It is subjective.

229
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:23.600
Hildur, you've been harassing Orm. So that
justice shall be done to the fullest, -

230
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:30.040
- I can do nothing but leave
  Orm perform the punishment in his own way.

231
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.880
Seriously? Orm? Therefore ...

232
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.480
Look, what you made me do.

233
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.800
Ouch! Straight in the pussy.

234
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.480
Now you went too far, Orm.
Now you went way over the line.

235
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.960
That is what you will get again for.

236
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.880
Then I wonder -

237
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.640
- unless your journey ends here.

238
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.320
Loke, then!

239
00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:57.160
Yes, it was a bit of a mess. I
has no more skin left in his hands.

240
00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.240
-But I got hold of the map.
- What map?

241
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:08.160
-The map from the funeral fleet.
-Yes, yes. I had almost forgotten that.

242
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.520
I'm not sure
if I need it anymore.

243
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.320
Was it anything else?

244
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.000
No?

245
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.240
Slave away.

246
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:47.360
Norheim is coming
to become the capital of culture.

247
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.440
That's more than my brother got.
He was chief for ten years.

248
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.240
He prioritized a little differently.

249
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.600
I've been chief for two months and
already has an installation in progress.

250
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:05.080
About that installation ... Rufus
want it to look like this and that.

251
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:10.320
Now we have run out of metal,
so we can't make it the way he wants to.

252
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.960
No? After all, it's a crisis.

253
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.640
Where can we
get hold of more metal a little fast?

254
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.280
Was a little solution oriented.

255
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:29.640
What we used to do is go out
expeditions. But I don't know if it's ...

256
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:36.040
-Yes, it could go.
-Do you think so?

257
00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.400
That we should go on a cruise?
Like in a proper cruise, like?

258
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:46.840
-Is it decided now?
-Yes. I am the chief, after all.

259
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.920
We are going on a cruise! We're going out
and loot and rape again!
