1
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.720
Folks, can I get
attention a little close?

2
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.760
First, I want to state that we do not
has been receiving water for over 12 hours.

3
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.480
-It is under every criticism.
- There will be water afterwards.

4
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.280
First, some practical information:
In a few steps we will be there.

5
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.440
None of you have been
in Norway before? You've been here?

6
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.760
No, but I have some relatives here
up so I can speak the language flawlessly.

7
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.600
People say I have
a world-class language drive.

8
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.640
It is totally sick in that case.

9
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.240
Then it's time for a family run.
Anyone want to be the first man?

10
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.560
Bjorn Gamling, you're the oldest. Maybe
you should take responsibility and jump first?

11
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.480
If anyone else wants to,
then they should be allowed it.

12
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.360
-Anyone else who wants to be a cheat?
-No, Bjorn can ...

13
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.160
Okay, if no one else has
I want to jump.

14
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.680
Surely there is a lot of honor in this?

15
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.480
Taking a clan is part of it
the most honorable thing you can do.

16
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.000
Let's just pull away
behind there, so Bjørn gets some running speed?

17
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.680
Then we look at
the other side, guys. To Valhalla!

18
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.520
It is so, yes ...

19
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:47.200
You can expect a lot of hard work,
but you will learn lots of new -

20
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.840
- and have some fun along the way. new
  friends you will also get.

21
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.440
-Questions?
-Is it well paid?

22
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.720
-It's not pay.
-We don't get paid?

23
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.760
Not to complain, but the flow of information on the boat is quite random.

24
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.880
Quite unnecessary
when we sit so close to each other.

25
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.680
I did not know
before yesterday that we were going to Norway.

26
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.040
-So you got too little information?
-Absolutely.

27
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.240
There is some failure in your system.

28
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.040
But then it comes
some information for you.

29
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.680
You saw it? Everyone saw it?

30
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.440
-Was there a little bit there?
- You're a chieftain.

31
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.920
Should not
be like that when you boss?

32
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.800
It's not quite me,
the "fear-based leadership" scheme.

33
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.800
Can you stand as a witness?

34
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.760
Yes, Oddvar. You will
maybe be a deputy?

35
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.520
-Don't quite know, I do.
-You do not know?

36
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:12.680
What's the worst that can happen
if I don't take the clan?

37
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.600
-What's worse than being crushed?
-Just.

38
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.840
I do not know. I have received
message to bring you up here.

39
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.880
You should jump to save the family
for the burden you are as old.

40
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:35.040
I'm 47. It's not that old.
I have a couple of good years left.

41
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:43.200
-I drop the whole clan.
- Don't think I'm jumping, either.

42
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.960
Any of you who want to jump? No?

43
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.080
Do you think Bjørn Gamling liked
to be crushed against the cliffs down there?

44
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.000
It's about doing something honorable
which is bigger than you.

45
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.680
-It's just not very tempting.
-Greit. I'm just a slave.

46
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.920
I can't force you into anything.

47
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.240
Can you promise you won't
coming near Norheim?

48
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.000
No problem.
You'll never see us again.

49
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.920
Super. Okay. Good bye!

50
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.480
I am not excited
just to come home.

51
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.760
I've always had the focus
on looting and things like that -

52
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.920
- while all the others have established
  themselves with wives and children and farm.

53
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.360
-I feel alone.
- But isn't that a bit ok?

54
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.720
Do what you want without having to
plan three full moons in advance?

55
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.480
I live in a tent. The only clothes
I have are the ones I stand and walk in.

56
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.360
I'm starting to feel pathetic.

57
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.000
You have to do something about it. A good one
a man like you should not be alone.

58
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.960
-You have plenty to offer.
- Not so much.

59
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.720
I almost think I have
hatch a plan already.

60
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.920
It's so insane
that it can work.

61
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:29.640
-There you are, yes. Did it go well?
-Yes, you'll never see them again.

62
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.720
-So it went very well.
-Good.

63
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:41.280
Orm? What's this?
Did you throw the old ones to death?

64
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.880
Yes, or they took the clan.

65
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.360
You've got the chance to rule
village. And people have to fold -

66
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.280
- in death because we have no food.
  What kind of leadership?

67
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.600
-Are you satisfied?
- It's starting to go down.

68
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.200
No one else thinks so.

69
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.720
Then we have to agree to disagree,
something I'm going to start saying.

70
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.200
The chief and his men were going
been home a month ago.

71
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.240
Quite special that you do not
have done something to get them home.

72
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.720
It is up to Odin to decide that.
What should I do?

73
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.360
Surely we could sacrifice some slaves?

74
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:28.440
Sacrifice? There will be too much screaming and
leven. It costs more than it tastes.

75
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.960
Your wife is also on the ship.
You must be sickly worried.

76
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.960
I'm really worried. It would have been
incredibly unlucky if they didn't come home.

77
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.480
Then I would be seated
with the permanent responsibility here.

78
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.480
-Isn't that what you dream of?
-I'm first in the inheritance line.

79
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.760
-But it's not a dream.
-No well. Then we sacrifice some slaves.

80
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.440
-I don't think we do.
-It's the mood for it among people.

81
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.680
We do it, Orm.

82
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:07.640
Then I make a chief decision
on it and say we do it.

83
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.040
Good. Come on.

84
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.200
Come on.

85
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.080
Odin, accept our second sacrifice!

86
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.000
Odin, accept our third sacrifice!
Bring our men home.

87
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:52.000
Wait! Are you
100% sure I have to be sacrificed?

88
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.560
I'm pretty sure of that.
Sacrifice is not an exact science.

89
00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.240
-But I think I'm driving.
-Yes, okay, okay.

90
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.960
But you guys
has sacrificed two slaves already.

91
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.480
You are not afraid
that the gods think you're trying too hard?

92
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.080
I like the way you think.
Very positive that you get involved.

93
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.560
-But I think we're just driving on.
- I thought I should mention it.

94
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.520
If one regrets, so be it
not sacrifice particularly reversible.

95
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.040
Ship! There's a ship coming!

96
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:37.280
-Thanks, Odin!
-See that. After all, it held two slaves.

97
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.520
Let's note it behind the ear.

98
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.640
-Hello, Frøya!
-You were, yes.

99
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:28.120
You can pretend you're happy
to see your husband. This is going to be stupid.

100
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:35.440
So good to see you! So good to see you.
Look at you, yes. Got color and stuff.

101
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.280
-Hi, Orm.
-Tell then.

102
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.360
-Some cool episodes, right?
- Lots of cool episodes.

103
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:49.360
Unfair to the other episodes
if one episode needs to be highlighted.

104
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:55.280
It went into one with fat episodes.
Lots of internal jargon.

105
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.200
-You didn't know anything anyway.
-Next time I have to join.

106
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.480
I had it with my back.
But I'm better now.

107
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:08.960
You can be proud of your wife.
Frøya participated in the looting 100%.

108
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.960
Join in quite a bit
many of the rapes as well.

109
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.280
Frøya coerced lots of monks.
I was taken to bed -

110
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.960
- when you suddenly
  moaning ...

111
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.680
-Did you do it?
-Of course. It does belong.

112
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.920
-Maybe it was a little unnecessary?
-I do not know.

113
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.800
It belongs to the whole package.
Had you been on a raid,

114
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:41.560
- You had a little more information though
  how the world works.

115
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:47.520
-Are you going to the guild tonight?
-Yes of course. Doesn't everyone have to?

116
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.200
We should not cool down a couple
lukewarm horns with mead with us first?

117
00:12:53.320 --> 00:13:00.240
Well ... Now everyone has from the boat
agreed to gather before the party -

118
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.960
- pour out some mead too
  our dead warriors and marble a little.

119
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.000
You came a few moments ago.

120
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.440
We should not be reminiscing
the last moments of the boat.

121
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.480
We must remember
the first monastery we raid.

122
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.640
Got it. It probably doesn't hurt
whether I'm a fly on the wall there?

123
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.400
-I can bring my own chair.
-Yes ...

124
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:31.080
It gets very cramped
if people start bringing chairs.

125
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.640
I can stand outside and watch and talk
with those going to the toilet ...

126
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.560
 I wonder if anyone said:
"One, two, three, no one else."

127
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.280
-Yes, that was it.
- Surely it is not run down in stone?

128
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:51.760
-You have to respect that.
-Otherwise, it doesn't mean anything.

129
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.720
It loses its magic.
It becomes something people just say.

130
00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.560
You know what?
Afterwards we meet in the guild hall.

131
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.680
-We do. It'll be fine.
-After you guys ...?

132
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.320
So can we.

133
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.880
I can go myself, then!

134
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.080
One little thing before I forget it.

135
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:37.680
On the ship
I wore a cape.

136
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.320
I lent it away
to one of your colleagues -

137
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.360
- who promised to return it
  when we reached our destination.

138
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:52.880
-Could you ask a little?
-Do not think so. Come on.

139
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.560
-There it is! There it is.
-Hi!

140
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:05.160
-It's me you borrowed the cap from.
- This is mine.

141
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.920
-Is it yours?
-Yes.

142
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.200
It's a bit of a coincidence if
we use the same tailor in Rome -

143
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.600
- and have the same family crest.
  I highly doubt that.

144
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.920
-But thats how it is.
-You can't even believe that.

145
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.920
You wear it amateurishly.
You dirty it.

146
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.040
-So you don't like dirt?
-No, who does?

147
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.680
-Open your mouth.
- I'm not going to yawn.

148
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.240
-Open your mouth.
-No.

149
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.360
Up. Up. Up, up.
Like that. Don't bite.

150
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.280
-Whose cape is that?
-Your.

151
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.440
What you don't get ...

152
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.400
I take it up with the management.

153
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:16.760
-Hey you. Hello. You're new here, right?
-Yes.

154
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:23.400
We have to share straw, we two. Kark
my name is. I should actually ...

155
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.440
I was to be sacrificed today,
but then I got away.

156
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.320
There was branding instead,
so I shouldn't feel lucky.

157
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:41.800
It's fine here, right? Shall
do I show you where to sleep?

158
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.600
Yes, here we sleep, then.
Good and warm among the animals.

159
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:54.440
You're kidding now, right? I will
do not sleep among goats and chickens.

160
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.040
-That's great, this.
-Top?

161
00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.320
Yes.

162
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.720
-You're not going to plunder reunion?
- Of course I should.

163
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.800
-Can't we take a mead here?
-No.

164
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:15.280
-What are you wearing around your neck?
- This? Munk chain.

165
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:20.600
-A kind of trophy I made.
- Is it a dick chain?

166
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:26.080
-It's from the monks, yes.
- Are they fighting, right?

167
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.560
Do you become hard with such a thing
utensils, it is quite a crisis after all.

168
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.640
After all, you are right on the ground.
The blood goes from the head down.

169
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.920
-You're guaranteed to faint.
- They don't care.

170
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.280
-This is the standard size.
-I have the same gear myself.

171
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.000
This is completely abnormal.

172
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.240
Poor people! What a handicap.

173
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.120
Friends.

174
00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.160
Brothers. Warriors.

175
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:30.560
We will celebrate that Odin has brought us
safe across the ocean and back home. Toast!

176
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:40.560
And not least, we should celebrate that we
has found the way to the country in the west, -

177
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:46.160
- a country so full of wealth that
  we will never experience another year again -

178
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:53.040
- no matter how miserable the chief vicar
  had to steer when I'm gone.

179
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:07.600
Now it should be celebrated.
Shame on anyone who doesn't get drunk!

180
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:26.360
-Yeah ... That's a good thing, then.
-Yes.

181
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.160
My race step has fallen asleep.
The benches inside are so hard.

182
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.160
They could cost
an animal skin or two.

183
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.640
-The race step falls asleep so fast!
-Rasstappen?

184
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.320
-Yes. Don't know what the race step is?
-No.

185
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:49.840
The pin sticking out between
penis and hole - on the perineum.

186
00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.360
The one who stays
when you are happy or excited.

187
00:19:53.480 --> 00:20:00.720
I've always called that race step.
See you in there.

188
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:13.440
The horse saw no difference
on horseshoe and dandelion.

189
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:22.800
Quite quaint
that we name plants.

190
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.960
It doesn't know the horse.

191
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:34.360
Olvar ... Liv ... My lady ...
It means "beautiful soft" in English.

192
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.720
Language Mighty?

193
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.400
Welcome back from the cruise.
Heard you looted well?

194
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.200
Yes, it was awesome really.

195
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.960
There was something
i could help you?

196
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.680
Yes, one small thing really.
You still have that farm?

197
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.080
-Yes, biggest in Norheim.
-And it's still going well?

198
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.800
It runs so it laughs.

199
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:12.960
That's what I wanted to talk to you about
about. I dig you. You know that.

200
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.240
I admire you
for everything you have achieved.

201
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:22.600
Thanks for that.
Cheers for that. Cheers to Arvid!

202
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.160
Then I thought I would
challenge yourself to an islet.

203
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.840
What? Holmgang?

204
00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:52.280
Yes. Then the winner can take over
the property and the wife of the loser.

205
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.000
Because that's how the rules are? It is
that's how the rules are, isn't it, Olav?

206
00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:03.800
-Votes, what you say.
-But you own nothing!

207
00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.160
No. But that's how the rules are.

208
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:14.800
And it gets too stupid not to
make use of the regulations.

209
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.560
I've built up
this farm from nothing.

210
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:24.360
It respects
i really appreciate you too.

211
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.120
I, Arvid, challenge
hereby Olvar to Holmgang!

212
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.760
Olvar?

213
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.120
Olvar?

214
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.440
Olvar?

215
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.680
-Olvar, are you sitting here hiding?
- I'm not hiding.

216
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:32.320
-I sit and think.
-You can just forget to hide.

217
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:39.840
Unless you are lined up for it
the islet, you will be biting, ostracized.

218
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.080
It's just that Arvid is so tough.

219
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.000
He has been trained to be
a warrior since he was a baby.

220
00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:54.000
He must have killed a thousand men. I
have not taken in a sword until today.

221
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.440
Don't be so crazy
on the defensive. You can beat him.

222
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.800
-It's 99% about setting.
-Does it?

223
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:10.880
Yes. If you raise 5%, and he
lowering down 5%, a lot is done.

224
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.440
-Are the margins so small?
-Yes.

225
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:22.440
If you also think a little outside
box, then anything can happen. Good luck!

226
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.720
-We'll see over there.
-We take away.

227
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.000
I have agreed to follow
with some girlfriends.

228
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:36.160
-Which girlfriends?
-Whatever. Old girlfriends.

229
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:41.160
-Shall I close the door?
-Yes, close the door, you.

230
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.040
-Sure?
-Yes!

231
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.800
Olvar.

232
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:17.400
-There you are. It was in the Earl's time.
-You wanted to exchange coins for poison?

233
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:24.120
Yes, that's right on a dot. I have
mess me up some islet here.

234
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.960
-Give me your sword.
-Yes.

235
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:41.360
-Don't give the sword with the tip first.
-Sorry.

236
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.720
It is
the deadliest poison you can find.

237
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:54.040
A scratch in his skin,
and he's dead in seconds.

238
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:59.920
Okay. Thanks.
I am indebted to you forever.

239
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:07.440
-I got money from you.
-Yes, yeah. But that's how you say.

240
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:15.480
Yes, so far. Just in this
the case was the money that mattered.

241
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.000
-Okay. Thanks.
-You're welcome.

242
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:35.960
Odin, today you must
get a new guest in Valhall.

243
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.400
Can I say
a few words before we begin?

244
00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.520
Yes. Olvar would say a few words.

245
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.920
Many of you
don't give me a chance.

246
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:58.080
To you I want to say something I have
carved on this rune stick.

247
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:04.840
"Little strokes fell great oaks."

248
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.640
-That was it?
-Yes.

249
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.240
I didn't quite understand it.

250
00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.600
What I mean to say to you, Arvid,
is that you will regret -

251
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.000
- that you challenged me to Holmgang.

252
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.600
This is the stupidest thing
you ever did.

253
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:30.520
Oh well. Why are you saying that now?
Do you have a secret weapon?

254
00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:38.760
This is the last thing I would say
to you: Pride stands for ... fall.

255
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.920
-For ...?
-Fall.

256
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:48.040
Then there was a lot of nice talking.
Get ready.

257
00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.440
May the best man win.

258
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.920
3, 2, 1. Run Holmgang!

259
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.840
Farm owner, that is!
Yes! It's totally wrong!

260
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.360
-Yeah, it was us, then.
-Yes.

261
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.360
-Nice.
Ol! You're really strong.

262
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.480
Kiss Me.

263
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.360
(Singing)
