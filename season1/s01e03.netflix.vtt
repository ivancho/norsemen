00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.800
Hi.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.880
Spit in the pot, Hildur.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.880
All who seek answers, spit in the pot.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.760
OK. I guess I can spit a little.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.040
You can do better than that.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.040
No answers without a real gob.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.680
You wish to know if your husband,
the chieftain, survives.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.880
Yes.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.120
[moaning]

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.080
Hi.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.640
-How's it going here?
-Good, good.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.440
[coughing]

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.120
You feeling OK?

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.640
As I like to say:
It's not how you're doing, it's...

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.600
-it's how you handle it.
-That's so true.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.360
I'm sure you'll be fine.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.200
I mean, how bad can it be?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.240
Arvid?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.040
Feel my heart.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.280
No, really feel it for real.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.600
-It's still strong, isn't it?
-Yeah. Feels fine.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.720
Just like a heart is supposed to feel

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.440
when you grab it... directly.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.440
Some blood there again.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.640
But it's OK.
I'll just wash it off.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.840
I see fire.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400
And...

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.720
I see... drigs and dregs.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.040
Knecks and drops.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.440
Does that mean
he will survive or die or...?

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.680
The gods are not ready
to receive him yet.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.240
That's great news!

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.120
I was really worried. I mean,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.680
He's laying down in the house
with his guts

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.720
basically hanging out
for everyone to see.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.000
If I die, Odin forbid,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.320
I want you to be chieftain.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.600
Not that girly-boy Orm.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.640
Me, as chieftain?
I don't know...

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.000
Believe in yourself, Arvid.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.560
You have it all in you,
you just don't know it yet.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.120
But Orm is next in line.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.040
So wouldn't that sour the mood a little?

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000
This is my decision.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.480
Tomorrow I'll inform the village.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.600
Loki!

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.160
[creaking]

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.080
No one?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.840
Drink.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.520
You must drink from the Prophesy Pot
if the prophesy is to come true.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.480
How many have spit in here before me?

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.560
I mean, I'm guaranteed
to be sick if I drink that.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.360
That's just how it works.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.920
Seriously?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.480
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.320
Agreed, but,
can I ask you one question?

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.240
Do you personally see to it
that these prophesies come true?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.960
No, I don't control the future.
The gods do.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.320
I'm merely a messenger. Drink, come on.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.000
If you don't have any influence,
I'd rather not drink that crap.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.920
Because, I mean,
the result is already given.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.840
You can't quarrel your way
out of destiny.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.520
Drink, and the prophecy
will be fulfilled.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.080
Everyone drinks.
Everyone has always drunk.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.080
Yes, but to be quite honest with you,
I think it's strange that no one

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.600
has questioned this practice before.
I mean, it's not logical.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.080
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to make your job harder.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.520
But just drinking spit
simply doesn't work for me.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.200
OK. Look in the chest.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.000
-The Map to the West?
-Yes.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.280
Unfortunately it's not ours to keep.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.800
I promised Jarl Varg that if
we found our way across the ocean

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.080
he should have the map.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.760
This is very important, Arvid.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.320
Varg, he's...

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.800
How should I put it?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.360
A quite unpredictable
and hot-headed man.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.840
We could end up with some

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.800
big problems.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.520
Orm is here.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.880
-Arvid.
-Orm.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.440
So,

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.440
dear brother...

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.680
How are you really doing?

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.520
Well, I can't help but complain.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.080
Well put.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.280
But seriously, Orm,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.400
I'm not in my best shape here.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.040
I cannot even lift my arms.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.040
Really?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.440
That bad?

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.280
So...

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.440
If I do

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.040
this.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.720
How does that feel?

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.200
Can you push upwards at all?

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.480
No, not a chance.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.440
No? OK. So...

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.480
So your arms and upper body are
too weak. What about your neck?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.800
Can you nod, or headbutt?

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.600
Headbutt?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.560
[chuckles]
No way.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.000
No?

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.400
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.240
How are you?

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.840
Well...

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.840
I don't know. It's...

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.640
I've been better, I suppose.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.880
Yeah.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.920
How about you?
How are you?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.040
I don't know. I just feel we have to
put our faith in Thor and Odin.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.000
At least the shaman was

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.280
really positive. So...

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.280
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.760
You know,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.360
the crazy thing is...

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.480
If Olav won't survive,
gods forbid,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.920
he said he wanted me
to take over as chieftain.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.200
-He said that?
-Yeah.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.880
I don't know. I'm probably not
the right guy for that job.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.560
Arvid.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.280
I think you will be
a wonderful chieftain.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.040
Yes! You're so, you're so... kind.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.240
And honest and warm and strong...

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.320
Really strong.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.120
The chieftain is dead!

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.200
He's dead in there!

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.240
He's dead!

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.120
-Olav!
-Olav has departed. It's terrible.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.920
I'm completely crushed.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.160
-I should have been there.
-It went quickly towards the end.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.400
The only thing I know
is that he died of natural causes.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.400
Did he have time to tell you he wanted
me to take over as chieftain?

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.880
Yes, yes.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.040
And his last words were that
that was just a very grotesque joke.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.720
That was not my impression,
it was a joke.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.840
You know what they say:
Those who take a joke just as a joke,

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.400
and seriousness seriously, they have
actually understood both poorly.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.880
-Yeah?
-And here the seriousness was the joke.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.640
I didn't quite catch that.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.480
But I don't know if I can accept this
just like that.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.800
Everyone here knows
that I am next in line.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.760
If you have a problem with that,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.120
then we have something
called "blood eagle"!

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.920
Seriously?
Is that how you intend to handle this?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.920
That's exactly
how I intend to handle this, Arvid!

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.440
That is how I handle things like this!

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.080
[clears throat]

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.880
[clears throat]

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.000
Odin.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.720
Today

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.960
you can set the great hall
in Valhalla

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.040
with your finest tableware.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.120
Hang up your most festive curtains
and decorate with wildflowers.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.320
In all the beautiful colors
of the rainbow.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.440
For today Olav is arriving.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.000
Dearest brother.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.800
Chieftain Olav.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.640
If you still had been among us today,

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.160
I know that you would have
given me a good, long hug

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.520
and said how much you regret
the way you have treated me.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.640
For so many, many years.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.280
You would probably shed a little tear too
while thinking about all the times

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.600
you didn't include me
in games as a child.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.840
And fun and parties as an adult.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.960
[sniffs]

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.360
But dry your tears, Olav.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.120
For I know that you would have said

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.320
that our village is now
in the best of hands

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.320
with me as the new chieftain!

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.160
[chanting]

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.440
Push him out.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.560
Farewell, brother!

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.480
Farewell, brother!

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.040
Why don't you just let me
do that, because I...

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.480
No, no, it's just that my
hands are very cold.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.920
And these arrows are too slippery
for my style of shooting.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.080
[lights arrow]

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.920
This is ridiculous!

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.920
The raft has to be set aflame
or else he won't get to Valhalla.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.560
Yes, yes.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.960
[lights arrow]

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.040
-Give me the bow. Give me the bow.
-No, no.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.080
Just let Arvid do it!

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.680
I'll do it. I'll handle it.
He's my brother.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.240
-Come on. This is really important.
-Orm!

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.000
Just one more arrow, just to be sure.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.880
For Thor and Odin's sake,
let Arvid do it!

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.760
No, no, no, no.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.520
It's too late. It's too late.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.480
If Thor and Odin had wanted me to hit,
then I would have done it.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.880
And I think it's very important
just to respect that.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.120
[crowd boos]

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.680
Who dares boo their own chieftain?

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.280
I'm really, really disappointed.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.400
You shouldn't boo your own chieftain.
That's just child's knowledge.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.800
Try firing an arrow with really cold
fingers yourself before you start booing.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.560
Have any of you
ever tried to fire an arrow

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.840
with really frozen fingers?

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.080
No, that's what I thought.
It really has a huge effect.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.480
So, but now you've learned
something today, as well.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.840
And there's no need to feel
down in the mouth.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.520
Because next weekend it's funeral feast!

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.480
Welcome, welcome.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.080
A bit late.
The funeral was yesterday.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.560
We're not here for the funeral.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.360
Rumor has it you went
on a raid to the West?

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.360
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, indeed.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.440
A very successful raid.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.520
Chieftain Olav swore that
he would draw up a map.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.880
To show how to get there.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.880
A map?
That's the first I've heard of it.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.960
I think my brother would have shared
that information with me.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.640
There's supposed to be a map
among Olav's possessions.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.480
A map showing the route
to the West or something?

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.120
Yeah, right, that.
We sent that out with the funeral raft.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.000
We thought we'd include some of
his most prized possessions.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.280
And he really was a fan of that map.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.880
-Are you serious?
-Serious as cancer.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.800
Jarl Varg won't like this.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.240
No, but it is what it is.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.560
The map is gone, and that's
just very, very unfortunate.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.240
Yeah. It's very unfortunate.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.800
That map...

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.960
Was it very valuable?

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.760
Yeah, the map was extremely valuable.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.600
-You can row, right?
-Yeah, I can row like a Viking.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720
Good.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.920
I'm sending you on a secret mission.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.280
-Wow.
-Yes.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.840
You have to row out
and find Olav's funeral raft.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.160
And you don't dare come back
before you've found that map.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.400
No, of course.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.760
Well, well, well.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.000
Rufus of Rome.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.960
I promised we would meet again.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.520
We had that

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.120
certain

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.800
bond.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.720
We had that special...

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.720
-Chemistry?
-No, no, that's not what I meant.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.000
I have to say that what you mentioned
about theater and acting,

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.840
really piqued my interest.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.920
-OK?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.960
And I'm trying to get some
sort of cultural lift.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.800
And I really want something like
that to happen here in Norheim.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.280
Well, making a theater production
is very resource demanding.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.560
Is it?

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.160
Mostly regarding human capital.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.280
Human capital?

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.800
Yeah, I mean, creative and talented minds.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.440
And most of all,
lots of theater experience.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.520
Oh, yes.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.920
That's absolutely essential.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.080
Experience, experience...

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.360
Which I happen to have, by the way.
An overload of experience.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.240
And talent.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.720
Talent?

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.080
Yes, they say I am
a once-in-a-generation talent.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.200
Wow.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.240
So they say.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.640
Rufus, I truly want to see with my own
eyes what you are capable of.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.720
I want you to prepare some
highlights of your repertoire

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.120
for the feast tonight.
Can you do that?

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.920
Yes. I can do that.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.440
Good.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.800
"And from under the veil,
 he rose and sang a song!" 

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.880
"About the mother of all creation."

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.960
"For you sang the Achaeans' fate
with truth and feeling."

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.640
"All of their actions
and their suffering."

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.880
"All the efforts

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.080
they exerted..."

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.320
People!

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.600
This... this is beautiful!

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.320
These are Odysseus's words to the
skald Demodocus in The Odyssey.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.880
It's art!

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.960
-Your first performance was incredible.
-Thank you. I'm actually an actor.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.280
-An educated actor.
-Rufus, could I steal you for a moment?

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.640
I'm just going to pee-pee,
and then I can meet you outside.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.240
Yes, sure.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.080
Loki!
Have you read these rune sticks?

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.240
No, but I've seen tons of them
up by the latrine.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.280
People are sitting there reading them
and laughing. What are they?

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.560
Rune sticks about me. And very
childish messages, I have to say.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.920
Huh, wow.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.280
But now that I'm chieftain,
I can finally put a stop to all this.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.200
Shall I?
Do you need help?

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.800
Listen, I've...

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.120
You know, speaking of theater, I, I...

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.360
I was very impressed by
what you did in there.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.240
Oh, really?

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.920
And I've been thinking
and I want to ask you:

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.040
Do you want to be

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.880
a theater man?

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.280
-A theater man?
-Yes.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.520
Someone who knows everything

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.440
and has the big responsibility
and all that.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.160
I wonder if you might mean...
creative director?

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.920
Yes! Yes, yes.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.080
Absolutely.
I just didn't remember

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.080
the term, at the moment.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.720
Is that something that maybe
is possible, that you might want to do?

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.320
I'm not sure you're fully aware
of who you're engaging.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.720
Because I'm uncompromising
when it comes to art.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.360
Yes, no, it's very important
to be uncompromising.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.040
I need full creative freedom.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.480
And I need to do things my way.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.360
This has to be taken serious.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.400
Yes, no, but indeed,
but I am very serious.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.560
Then my recommendation
is to take immediate action.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.000
To lift this town up

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.360
from this barbaric shithole
that it is now.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.960
How do we do that?

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.880
Well, the obvious thing would be
to make an installation.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.040
An installation? Yes.
That's a great idea. Let's do it.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.640
What is that?

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.240
Well, it's a three-dimensional sculpture
made of objects,

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.320
often objects
from everyday life.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.440
The important thing here
is its symbolic value.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.120
-Yes.
-It's invaluable.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.960
Great, great.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.120
How do you see this?

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.440
How do you imagine it?

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.760
I have a very exciting vision.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.360
Vision? Yes.
That's very important.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.200
[men chattering]

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.200
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me!

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.560
What in Hel do you think you're doing?

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.280
-Isn't this a funeral party?
-Yes, sort of.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.120
But it started some time ago.
And punctuality is a virtue.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.120
Which is something
I've decided to start saying.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.920
Yeah, I'm sorry.
We were just sitting around drinking.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.520
-And had such a nice time.
-And?

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.640
You know how it is.
The pre-party's usually the best part.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.440
When you get to the actual party,
everyone goes to their...

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.080
Arvid, Arvid, Arvid.
Hush, hush, hush.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.480
Hush.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.320
This is a feast
to honor your new chieftain.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.000
Not some anecdotal get-together

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.600
about the excellence
of pre-parties contra parties.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.320
Isn't this feast supposed to be
in memory of Olav?

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.040
Aren't we going to pour out mead
and laugh and cry and mourn and stuff?

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.520
Arvid, if I as the brother
of the deceased

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.120
have managed to move on and forget,

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.240
I think the rest of you
can do the exactly same.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.640
And anyway, I thought this would be
a perfect occasion for certain people

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.800
to swear allegiance to their
new chieftain and show respect.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.280
-Which certain people?
-You, Arvid.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.040
Unless you'd rather become a niding
and be chased away from the village?

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.480
-No, of course not.
-No?

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.560
Wonderful. Lovely.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.960
Lovely. Kiss my hand.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.080
-Huh?
-Kiss my hand!

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.880
Kiss it.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.880
Kneel.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.920
See?

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.840
That wasn't so hard, was it?

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.320
You have a new chieftain
and a new regime.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.320
And by tomorrow you will see
that things have changed around here.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.080
Orm?

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.800
What in Loki's name, Orm?

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.400
Well, well, well.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.080
If it isn't the rune-stick
maker himself.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.160
-What?
-I said, well, well, well.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.840
If it isn't the rune-stick
maker himself.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.000
Okay.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.200
Hildur, I pray to Thor and Odin

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.600
that you my dear sister-in-law
are not responsible for this.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.240
I have no clue
what you're talking about.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.360
So none of you have
been carving runesticks

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.960
with insulting
messages about me?

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.120
It wasn't me, but what does it say?

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.040
It doesn't matter what it says.
That's beside the point.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.280
-Have you done this?
-No.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.920
Well, I know it's one of you.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.760
So perhaps the guilty party would like
to come forward and confess right away

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.120
so we can get this over with.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.440
No? OK. OK!

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.520
Then I guess,

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.040
to prove this,
there's only one thing to do.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.080
-Writing samples.
-[scoffs]

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.880
You're going to carve
exactly what it says here.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.480
And then afterwards we'll compare and see
whose carving resembles this the most.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.880
So get started.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.760
Ow!

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.680
Yes, this must be the one.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.440
Whose writing sample is this?

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.240
It's mine.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.720
You disappoint me.
Why do such a thing?

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.280
It's just innocent fun.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.320
Uh-huh, so you think this
is just an innocent joke?

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.160
-Yeah, it's humor.
-Humor?

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.320
Yes.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.680
-So you think punishment is humor too?
-Punishment for writing rune sticks?

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.640
-What happened to freedom of speech?
-Okay, it's like this:

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.800
I disapprove of what you say, but I will
defend to the death your right to say it.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.840
Great.
I was really starting to wonder.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.520
But in this specific case
you went too far.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.840
Seriously?

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.760
Ow! Orm?

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.200
Hildur.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.360
It has been proven that you are
the woman behind the rune sticks

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.680
with the following messages:

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.320
"Orm er rassr-agr." 

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.280
Which means Orm is an unmanly,

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.240
-homosexual, perverted person.
-[laughing]

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.480
See you completely miss the mark.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.240
In order for humor to be relevant,

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.200
it needs to be rooted in reality.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.960
And this is where you so
completely and utterly fail.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.440
I think it's quite fine you
don't find it funny,

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.800
but obviously humor is
a very subjective thing.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.400
Hildur,

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.200
you have slandered Orm.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.800
And to make justice come true,
I have no other option

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.040
than to let Orm

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.000
exercise his punishment his own way.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.280
-Go on.
-What?

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.480
Orm...

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.360
Seriously?

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.440
See what you made me do?

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.760
Straight in the gut.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.520
Now you went too far.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.360
Way too far.
I'll get you for this!

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:18.440
That makes me wonder if 

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.440
maybe this is where
 your journey ends? 

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.040
Loki! 

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.400
[door closes]

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.360
[clears throat]

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.840
That was quite a trip.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.960
I don't have any skin left on my hands.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.880
But I got you the map.
There you are.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.880
Map?
What map?

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.400
The map from Chieftain Olav's
funeral raft.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:21.120
I had completely forgotten about that map.
I'm not sure I have any use for it now.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.200
Was there anything else?

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.000
Nope.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.480
Slave on.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.880
Norheim is going to be
a cultural capital.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.280
You know that?

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.840
That's something my brother
never achieved

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.840
and he was chieftain
for more than ten years.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.000
Wow.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.080
Well he kind of had other priorities.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.360
Yes, and I've been chieftain
for two months,

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.360
and already have
an installation going up

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.280
that really inspires respect.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.560
-About that installation.
-Yes?

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.520
Rufus wants it to look a certain way.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.640
Yes, he's uncompromising.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.960
But now we have run out of metal
and stuff to build it the way he wants.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.360
No, no, no.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.200
No, no, no, that's horrible!

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.280
How can we get our hands on more
metal and things like that, quickly?

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.640
Come on, Arvid.
Be a little solution-oriented.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.840
What we usually do when
we need stuff, is go out raiding.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.560
But I don't know if that's...

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.920
-Raiding?
-Yeah, is that your...

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.480
No, no, that could work.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.920
-Really?
-Yes.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.200
-Raiding, as in a proper raid?
-Yes, yes, that's what I mean.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.720
Is that decided, then?

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.200
Yes. Yes, I'm chieftain.
I can decide things like this.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.160
Yes, we're going out raiding!

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.800
We're going to pillage and rape again!
Woo-hoo!
